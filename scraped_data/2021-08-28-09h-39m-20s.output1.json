[Among the\ndead](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/us/tennessee-floods-victims.html) are\n7-month old twins, a 15-year-old girl and an Army veteran who died after\nhelping his wife and daughter escape.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say whether any single action could have prevented those\ndeaths, especially given the ferocity of the flooding. But interviews with\nclimate and disaster experts and a review of state and federal data show how\ngovernments have been slow to adapt to growing threats and failed to take\nsteps that, together, could have lessened the damage.\n\n\u201cThese extreme weather events will become more intense and more frequent,\u201d\nsaid Hiba Baroud, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at\nVanderbilt University in Nashville who specializes in resilience. \u201cWe need to\nbe more proactive, and think about ways to prevent or at least mitigate the\nimpact of these events.\u201d\n\n## Refusing flood insurance\n\nThe story of the disaster in Humphreys County, the hardest-hit area in the\nstate, arguably begins in the late 1970s, when the federal government began\noffering communities around the country a deal: If they agreed to take basic\nprecautions to limit the damage from flooding, the government would let people\nin those communities buy publicly subsidized flood insurance.\n\nMost cities and counties said yes. But not all of them. Humphreys County\ndeclined to take part, [federal records\nshow](https://www.fema.gov/cis/TN.pdf). So did neighboring Houston County,\nwhich was hit as well over the weekend. (Some cities within those counties,\nsuch as Waverly, which was hit hardest by the floods, do take part in the\nprogram.)\n\nA spokeswoman for Humphreys County said officials there were unavailable to\ncomment. But in general, communities that decide to stay out of the flood\ninsurance program typically do so because of an aversion to building\nrestrictions, according to Roy Wright, who ran the program until 2018.\n\nNot participating in the flood insurance program hurts communities in a number\nof ways, according to Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of\nState Floodplain Managers. It means people can\u2019t buy flood insurance, making\nit harder to rebuild after a flood. And it prevents people from getting some\ntypes of disaster assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\n## No building codes\n\nAs officials in Humphreys County spurned the federal government\u2019s offer of\nflood insurance, they were shaping the future of the county in another way: by\ndeclining to adopt residential building codes.\n\nThose codes govern the way houses must be built, to make them more likely to\nwithstand natural disasters and other dangers. For example, Nashville, where\ncatastrophic flooding in 2010 displaced [thousands of\npeople](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/opinion/2010-nashville-flood.html),\nrequires the ground floor of new houses be constructed at least four feet\nabove the expected height of a major flood, one of the toughest requirements\nin the country.\n\nImage\n\nFlooding in Nashville in May 2010. The city tightened building rules after the\ndisaster, which killed 26. Credit...Mark Humphrey/Associated Press\n\nBut Humphreys County, despite being only 70 miles west of Nashville and\nsubject to a similar threat from flash floods, has no building code, according\nto [state\ndata](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/commerce/documents/fire_prevention/posts/DBI-\nList.pdf). Nor does Houston County, along with some three dozen other counties\nin Tennessee. (As with flood insurance, some cities within those counties have\ntheir own codes.)\n\nThat difference is possible because of a decision by Tennessee lawmakers to\navoid imposing rules on local governments. While most states adopt a building\ncode and make that code mandatory for all of their cities and counties,\nTennessee lets local governments decide whether to follow the state rules, or\nestablish rules of their own, or have none at all.\n\n\u201cAny kind of standard or code is to protect the public,\u201d said Norma Jean\nMattei, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers and a\nprofessor at the University of New Orleans. \u201cIt really is all about public\nsafety.\u201d\n\nIn Houston County, Mayor James Bridges said he\u2019d like to have a building code.\nBut he said there wasn\u2019t enough tax revenue to pay for the staff to manage and\nenforce those rules.\n\n\u201cWith 8,000 people and a very small tax base, we just don\u2019t have the money to\nhave all these different departments that they have in larger cities,\u201d Mr.\nBridges said. \u201cWe have so many other needs.\u201d\n\n## Flood maps understated the risk\n\nAs homes were being constructed in Humphreys County without a building code,\nthe county\u2019s ability to prepare for flooding was also being affected by a\ndecision in Washington.\n\nFEMA produces maps showing which areas are at risk from flooding, so that\nhomeowners, builders and local officials can make informed decisions about\nwhere and how to build houses. Federal law requires the agency to review its\nflood maps at least once [every five years](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/joel-\nscata/femas-outdated-and-backward-looking-flood-maps) and update them if\nneeded.\n\nBut the map for Humphreys County hasn\u2019t been updated since 2009, according to\n[FEMA data](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home). Hickman County, which is\nsoutheast of Humphreys and was also flooded, hasn\u2019t had its map updated since\n2008.\n\nIn addition to the maps\u2019 being out of date, the methodology used by those FEMA\nmaps underestimated the extent of the flood risk facing the region, according\nto calculations by the First Street Foundation, a group of academics and\nexperts who issued [their own\nestimates](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/29/climate/hidden-\nflood-risk-maps.html) last year, which Realtor.com uses to inform home buyers\nabout flood risks.\n\nImage\n\nDeanne Criswell, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Governor\nBill Lee of Tennessee inspected damage in Waverly on Wednesday.Credit...Mark\nHumphrey/Associated Press\n\nFEMA\u2019s flood maps show that just 781 properties in Humphreys County are at\nrisk from a so-called 100-year flood, 6.2 percent of all properties. First\nStreet estimates the number is more than three times as high.\n\nIn other counties affected by the flooding last weekend, the discrepancy is\neven greater. The number of properties threatened by flooding in Hickman\nCounty, based on First Street\u2019s data, is five times as high as what FEMA\u2019s\nmaps show. In Dickson County, the number is 10 times as high.\n\nThat difference reflects the fact that FEMA\u2019s maps look at the flood threat\nfrom main river channels but don\u2019t address the risks from smaller creeks and\ntributaries, according to Jeremy Porter, a professor at the City University of\nNew York and head of research and development for First Street. \u201cAll of the\nsmaller tributaries and streams that were overwhelmed with precipitation\nrunoff are currently unmapped in this area,\u201d Dr. Porter said.\n\nA spokeswoman for FEMA, Jaclyn Rothenberg, said the agency prioritized which\nareas to update first, and the onus was on local officials to seek new maps.\nHumphreys County and Hickman County \u201chave not made requests for map updates,\u201d\nshe said. Ms. Rothenberg said the contrasting flood maps developed by FEMA and\nFirst Street were \u201cdifferent tools for different intended uses.\u201d\n\n## Vague warnings\n\nBy the afternoon of Friday, Aug. 20, as weather forecasters in central\nTennessee began to predict intensifying rain overnight in Humphreys County \u2014\nwhich has no building codes, no flood insurance and outdated flood maps \u2014\nthere was one big decision left: when and how to warn people.\n\nAt 4:55 p.m., the National Weather Service\u2019s Nashville office asked local TV\nand radio stations to warn people that, in addition to the heavy rainfall of\nthe previous few days, that night could bring an additional 2 to 4 inches.\n\n\u201cHigher amounts may be possible,\u201d [the message\nsaid](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/wx/afos/p.php?pil=FFAOHX&e=202108202155).\n\u201cBe prepared to take action should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.\u201d It did not\nsay what action people should be prepared to take.\n\nAt 6:09 a.m. the next morning, the Weather Service began sending warnings\ndirectly to cellphones. \u201cA FLASH FLOOD WARNING is in effect for this area,\u201d\nthat message said. \u201cDo not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area\nsubject to flooding or under an evacuation order.\u201d\n\nBut by the time those first messages started hitting people\u2019s phones, there\nwas little time to react. \u201cThey received the notification on their phone at\nabout the same time the water was at their door,\u201d said Dale Popp, the\nemergency management director for Houston County.\n\nImage\n\nKeys and a flag recovered from the wreckage in Waverly this\nweek.Credit...Brett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nThe warnings from the National Weather Service should have gone out before the\nflooding started, according to Sarah Tuneberg, an emergency manager who\nstarted a company called Geospiza that helps local governments protect people\nduring disasters. And she said those warnings should have given people\nspecific instructions on whether to leave their homes.\n\nKrissy Hurley, the warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather\nService in Nashville, said her office decided to alert people to avoid travel\nonce it got reports of roads flooding. She said the agency was wary of sending\nalerts too early.\n\n\u201cIf you did that before it starts raining, people are going to get really\nannoyed at you,\u201d Ms. Hurley said.\n\nAnd her office doesn\u2019t have the authority to customize the phrasing in those\nalerts, Ms. Hurley said, which she said were standard messages agreed to by\nthe National Weather Service and FEMA.\n\nIn Waverly, Linda Ragsdale saw the warnings. But, as she recalled them, the\nalerts were vague and generic, cautioning that there could be flooding in\nMiddle Tennessee.\n\nShe had no inkling that she would wind up crawling into her attic with her\ndog, her medication and her cellphone, waiting for hours while she could hear\nwood in her house groan and snap.\n\nHer son called her early Saturday morning, asking if she had gotten any water.\n\u201cYou could see puddles in people\u2019s yards,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nAround 8:30 a.m., she got up and looked again. The surge was filling her yard.\nThe water, she said, was \u201cswift and quick, and I didn\u2019t have time to get to my\ncar.\u201d\n\nSeveral feet of water rushed through her home. It was gutted. She lost her car\nas well. She said she did not have flood insurance, nor did anyone else on her\nstreet.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I could have done,\u201d Ms. Ragsdale added. \u201cIt just happened\nso quick. It was too quick.\u201d\n\nRick Rojas and Jamie McGee contributed reporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n", "name": "How Government Decisions Left Tennessee Exposed to Deadly Flooding", "date_of_evidence": "20210827", "data": {"RSS Feed": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Climate.xml", "Media_Cloud_ID": 1, "Company Name": "New York Times (Environment)"}, "source": "D5", "date_of_scrape": "20210828", "project": "Climate Change", "scraper": "rss_media"}, {"ref": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/insider/united-nations-climate-report.html", "extract": "A Times journalist distills the recent U.N. report and talks about how he treats a beat that can get more than a little gloomy.", "text": "[Times Insider](/section/reader-center)|In Climate Coverage, Reporting the\nGrim Facts, but Also the Fight\n\n[](/)[](/)\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/insider/united-nations-climate-report.html\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=9869919170&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Finsider%2Funited-nations-climate-report.html%3Fsmid%3Dfb-share&name=In%20Climate%20Coverage%2C%20Reporting%20the%20Grim%20Facts%2C%20but%20Also%20the%20Fight&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F)\n  * [](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=In%20Climate%20Coverage%2C%20Reporting%20the%20Grim%20Facts%2C%20but%20Also%20the%20Fight%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Finsider%2Funited-nations-climate-report.html%3Fsmid%3Dwa-share)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Finsider%2Funited-nations-climate-report.html%3Fsmid%3Dtw-share&text=In%20Climate%20Coverage%2C%20Reporting%20the%20Grim%20Facts%2C%20but%20Also%20the%20Fight)\n  * [](mailto:?subject=NYTimes.com%3A%20In%20Climate%20Coverage%2C%20Reporting%20the%20Grim%20Facts%2C%20but%20Also%20the%20Fight&body=From%20The%20New%20York%20Times%3A%0A%0AIn%20Climate%20Coverage%2C%20Reporting%20the%20Grim%20Facts%2C%20but%20Also%20the%20Fight%0A%0AA%20Times%20journalist%20distills%20the%20recent%20U.N.%20report%20and%20talks%20about%20how%20he%20treats%20a%20beat%20that%20can%20get%20more%20than%20a%20little%20gloomy.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Finsider%2Funited-nations-climate-report.html%3Fsmid%3Dem-share)\n  *   *   * \n\n### [Climate Change](https://www.nytimes.com/section/climate)\n\n  * [Pesticide Ruling](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/climate/pesticides-epa-chlorpyrifos.html)\n  * [Western Drought](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/climate/western-drought-forecast-noaa.html)\n  * [Drilling in Alaska](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/climate/alaska-willow-oil.html)\n  * [Wildfire Tracker](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/wildfires-air-quality-tracker.html)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nSupported by\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nTimes Insider\n\n# In Climate Coverage, Reporting the Grim Facts, but Also the Fight\n\nA Times journalist distills the recent U.N. report and talks about how he\ntreats a beat that can get more than a little gloomy.\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=9869919170&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Finsider%2Funited-nations-climate-report.html%3Fsmid%3Dfb-share&name=In%20Climate%20Coverage%2C%20Reporting%20the%20Grim%20Facts%2C%20but%20Also%20the%20Fight&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F)\n  * [](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=In%20Climate%20Coverage%2C%20Reporting%20the%20Grim%20Facts%2C%20but%20Also%20the%20Fight%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Finsider%2Funited-nations-climate-report.html%3Fsmid%3Dwa-share)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Finsider%2Funited-nations-climate-report.html%3Fsmid%3Dtw-share&text=In%20Climate%20Coverage%2C%20Reporting%20the%20Grim%20Facts%2C%20but%20Also%20the%20Fight)\n  * [](mailto:?subject=NYTimes.com%3A%20In%20Climate%20Coverage%2C%20Reporting%20the%20Grim%20Facts%2C%20but%20Also%20the%20Fight&body=From%20The%20New%20York%20Times%3A%0A%0AIn%20Climate%20Coverage%2C%20Reporting%20the%20Grim%20Facts%2C%20but%20Also%20the%20Fight%0A%0AA%20Times%20journalist%20distills%20the%20recent%20U.N.%20report%20and%20talks%20about%20how%20he%20treats%20a%20beat%20that%20can%20get%20more%20than%20a%20little%20gloomy.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Finsider%2Funited-nations-climate-report.html%3Fsmid%3Dem-share)\n  *   *   * \n\n![An infrared image of methane emissions.

Every few years since 1990,\nthe U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has put out comprehensive\nassessments of the latest science around global warming, which means\nessentially summarizing thousands of existing studies into a coherent picture.\nThis was the sixth such assessment, and hundreds of scientists had been\nworking to put it together for months.\n\nFor [this particular\nreport](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/climate/climate-change-report-ipcc-\nun.html), we were able to get our hands on a few early drafts that allowed us\nto figure out what was new and noteworthy here. And my colleague [Henry\nFountain](https://www.nytimes.com/by/henry-fountain) and I called up a number\nof scientists beforehand to get a better sense of how climate research has\nadvanced since the I.P.C.C.\u2019s last big assessment in 2013. That early prep\nwork helped us write an initial version of the story ahead of time. Then, when\nthe panel released a finalized embargoed draft to reporters three days before\nits release, we could quickly check our facts to make sure we hadn\u2019t missed\nanything big and then called up more authors for official comment.\n\n **What is the significance of a report like this?**\n\nIn a lot of ways, the overall picture on climate change hasn\u2019t shifted much\nsince the first I.P.C.C. report in 1990. Scientists have been warning us for\ndecades that emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation can and will warm\nthe planet, with damaging consequences.\n\nBut a few big things are different now. First, global warming is much more\npronounced today than it was back then. Countries around the world have\ncontinued to increase their emissions, and the planet is now about 1.1 degrees\nCelsius hotter than it was in the 19th century. That means many of the impacts\nscientists have long warned about \u2014 more frequent heat waves, more severe\ndroughts, ice sheets melting in Greenland and Antarctica that push up sea\nlevels along the coasts \u2014 can now be seen very clearly in the present tense.\nThis latest report offered the clearest look yet at how climate change is\nalready, today, fueling a rise in extreme weather across the globe.\n\nAnd scientists are now able to model with much more precision what\u2019s likely to\nhappen in the future. So there\u2019s more confidence now that humans have\nbasically locked in another half a degree or so of total global warming over\nthe next 30 years.That adds an important twist to the challenge facing\nhumanity: Yes, we\u2019ll have to slash emissions if we want to prevent future\nglobal warming from getting even worse. But there are also dangers that are\nnow unavoidable and we\u2019ll need to take steps to adapt, such as [managing\nforests to reduce wildfire\nrisk](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/climate/wildfires-climate-\npolicy.html) or [protecting people in cities from heat\nwaves](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/climate/heat-waves-cities.html).\n\n **What questions did the U.N. report raise for you?**\n\nOne of the starkest points in the report is that nations of the world\nessentially need to zero out all of their fossil-fuel emissions over the next\nfew decades if we want to avoid an even bigger rise in global warming than\nwhat\u2019s already locked in. Plus we probably need to figure out how to suck vast\nquantities of carbon dioxide [back out of the\natmosphere](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/climate/carbon-removal-\ntechnology.html).\n\nDoing all that would require an overhaul of the global energy system at a\nspeed without precedent in human history. It\u2019s staggering. So how do we do\nthat? What technologies do we need? What sort of problems or dislocations\nmight a huge transformation like that create? What mistakes might we make\nalong the way? There are lots of smart people who think that this\ntransformation is doable, but it certainly won\u2019t be easy.\n\n **Climate coverage is a huge focus at The Times, but the topic can be\nunsettling for readers. Is this something you think about as you report and\nwrite these articles?**\n\nWe do think about this a lot. When scientists are warning that global warming\nwill impose real dangers and hardships around the world, I don\u2019t think we can\nshy away from reporting that as plainly as we can, even if it can be scary or\ndisheartening. It\u2019s impossible to deal with a challenge like climate change\nunless we can clearly see what we\u2019re up against.\n\nBut there\u2019s also so much more to the climate story than merely doom and gloom.\nAt the Climate desk and elsewhere at The Times, we write about people and\ncities [coming up with creative\nideas](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/climate/shinnecock-long-island-\nclimate.html) for [protecting\nthemselves](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/climate/canada-flood-homes-\nbuyout.html) against extreme weather. We write about how climate change\n[intersects with existing social\ninequalities](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-\nredlining-cities-global-warming.html), and what might be done in response. We\nwrite about inventors and businesses tinkering with [novel\nstrategies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/business/concrete-cement-\nmanufacturing-green-emissions.html) for [cutting\nemissions](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/electric-trucks-\ncatenary-wire.html). We write about how climate change is [transforming\npolitics](https://www.nytimes.com/by/lisa-friedman). We write about how\nindividuals [wrestle with their gut-level\nfeelings](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/sunday-review/depression-climate-\nchange.html) on climate change.\n\nClimate change \u2014 along with efforts to cut emissions and limit the damage \u2014 is\ngoing to be a central fact about the world for decades to come, touching on so\nmany different aspects of modern life. Some of those stories will be grim,\nsome will be hopeful. The trick is to try to capture that world, as best we\ncan, in all its messy complexity.\n\n **Has reading this report, or previous reports, changed your own behavior at\nall?**\n\nI generally think that individual efforts to cut emissions are great, but most\npeople\u2019s choices are constrained by the environment around them. So, for\ninstance, I mostly walk or bike or take the bus to get around every day, but\nit\u2019s easy for me to do so because I live in a walkable neighborhood in\nWashington with easy transit options. Most people in the United States don\u2019t\nhave that choice, because most cities [simply aren\u2019t built like\nthat](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/climate/biden-public-transit-\namtrak.html). Finding ways to transform our built environment so that more\npeople have alternatives to driving would go so much further than trying to\nguilt people into driving less when they don\u2019t have much choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n", "name": "Climate Change Reporter Covers a Mix of Angst and Ambition", "date_of_evidence": "20210827", "data": {"RSS Feed":

Ranchers are being forced to sell off portions of\nherds they have built up for years, often at fire-sale prices, to stay in\nbusiness.\n\nSome won\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really bad situation,\u201d said Randy Weigel, a cattle buyer, who said\nthis drought may force some older ranchers to retire. \u201cThey\u2019ve worked all\ntheir lives to get their cow herd to where they want, and now they don\u2019t have\nenough feed to feed them.\u201d\n\nSince December, in the weekly maps produced by the [United States Drought\nMonitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/), all of North Dakota has been\ncolored in shades of yellow, orange and red, symbolizing various degrees of\ndrought. And since mid-May, McHenry County, where Mr. Rice ranches and farms,\nhas been squarely in the middle of a swath of the darkest red, denoting the\nmost extreme conditions.\n\nThe period from January 2020 to this June has been the driest 18 months in\nMcHenry and 11 other counties in the state since modern record keeping began\n126 years ago, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been ranching for 47 years and then this year had to come along,\u201d said\nJohn Marshall, who ranches with his son, Lane, not far from Mr. Rice in this\nsprawling county where the county seat, Towner, bills itself as the cattle\ncapital of North Dakota. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing I can ever remember.\u201d\n\nDrought conditions that are affecting [nearly half the land area of the lower\n48 states](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/us/drought.html) are helping\nsend beef prices higher in America\u2019s grocery stores. But ranchers here say\nthey aren\u2019t seeing that money \u2014 slaughterhouses and other middlemen are. If\nanything, the ranchers said, they are losing money because they are getting\nless from the forced sale of their animals.\n\nThe Marshalls have already sold about 100 cows and plan to sell at least\nanother 120, which would leave them with about two-thirds of their usual herd.\n\u201cNever had to do it before,\u201d Mr. Marshall said.\n\nMr. Rice\u2019s corn, which is stored as silage to feed his animals later in the\nyear, is so short that if he tried to harvest now it he couldn\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s\nunchoppable,\u201d he said.\n\nImage\n\nDarrell Rice, in an oat field on his ranch outside Towner, N.D., in late June,\nshowed how high the crop would normally have been.\n\nImage\n\nCorn stalks, curled, stunted and without cobs because of drought, on John and\nLane Marshall\u2019s ranch.\n\nIf he gets some rain \u2014 a big if, as the forecast into the fall is for\ncontinued heat and dryness \u2014 the corn may reach six feet, or half its usual\nheight. Even then he would be looking at a shortage of feed, and would very\nlikely have to have his cows weighed at the communal ranchers\u2019 scale off Main\nStreet in Towner and then sold to a buyer elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get silage,\u201d he said, \u201cthe cows are going to town.\u201d\n\nRachel Wald, who works for North Dakota State University advising and\nsupporting ranchers, said that livestock auction houses, called sale barns,\nhad been very busy this spring and summer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 2,000 critters heading\ndown the road each week\u201d in the county, she said. By some estimates, half the\ncattle in the state may be gone by fall.\n\nFor ranchers who have spent years building up the genetics of their herd, that\ncan mean a giant step backward. \u201cEvery year we try to better our breed,\u201d said\nShelby Wallman, who with her husband, Daryl, has been ranching for decades in\nRhame, in the southwestern corner of the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a calling,\u201d she said. \u201cYou spend your entire life with these cattle. I\ncan tell you, there\u2019s going to be tears.\u201d\n\nNorth Dakotans have seen drought many times before. One in 1988 was\nparticularly bad, although John Marshall and others who made it through that\nyear said the current drought is worse.\n\nRanchers point to the variable nature of the climate here \u2014 where a dry year\nor two may easily be followed by a wet period \u2014 instead of talking about\nclimate change. Yet climate change is occurring in North Dakota, as it is\neverywhere else.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the epicenter of a changing climate,\u201d said Adnan Akyuz, the state\u2019s\nclimatologist and a professor at North Dakota State University. The state has\nwarmed by 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1.3 degrees Celsius) over the past\ncentury, he said. That\u2019s one of the largest increases in the United States.\n\nImage![Raking what little has grown on Shane Anderson&rsquo;s oat field\noutside Towner. At summer&rsquo;s end, the field will have produced less than\nhalf it would have in a normal\nyear.](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/12/science/00cli-\nndakotadrought7/merlin_192812814_29d3378c-a3df-472c-a648-60a32d9c53d8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale)\n\nRaking what little has grown on Shane Anderson\u2019s oat field outside Towner. At\nsummer\u2019s end, the field will have produced less than half it would have in a\nnormal year.\n\nImage\n\nRachel Wald of North Dakota State University tested levels of sulfates and\ntotal dissolved solids concentration in a watering hole on John Marshall\u2019s\nranch.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s climate is expected to become even more variable, with more\nextreme rainfall and heat. And as elsewhere, droughts are expected to grow in\nintensity and frequency.\n\nConditions are highly variable in large part because North Dakota is so far\nfrom the oceans, which have a moderating effect on climate. When the state\ndoesn\u2019t get moisture from them, it relies on local sources, including lakes,\nrivers and reservoirs, along with moist air that funnels into the region in\nlate spring and summer from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBut that Gulf moisture did not arrive this year. And heat has dried up many of\nthe local water sources. The result is air that sucks all the moisture it can\nfrom the soil and from plants.\n\nSigns of drought-stressed vegetation can be seen across McHenry County.\nStunted silage corn like Mr. Rice\u2019s is called pineapple corn, because the\ntight leaves make it look more like a pineapple plant. Elsewhere, soybean\nplants have flipped their leaves over to reduce photosynthesis and thus the\nneed for water, giving them a paler green appearance.\n\nAnd in the Marshalls\u2019 pastures, grass that would normally be green and reach\nthe knee is brown and stubby.\n\nImage\n\nLane Marshall, speaking with his father, John, on their ranch. \u201cIt\u2019s stuff you\ndon\u2019t want to do,\u201d the elder Mr. Marshall said of selling off cattle.\n\nImage\n\nGrazing on stubs of grass on the Marshall ranch.\n\nThe Marshalls rely on clean well water pumped into troughs for most of their\ncattle. But they and other ranchers also use watering holes, which collect\nsnow runoff and rain. And as watering holes dry up, nutrients and other\ncompounds in the water become more concentrated, which can sicken animals.\n\nIn one of the Marshalls\u2019 watering holes, the level had dropped by several\nfeet. Ms. Wald, from the university, tested for sulfates and dissolved solids\nand told the Marshalls that the water was still good. But she noticed\nsomething else.\n\n\u201cLane, one of the things I\u2019d watch out for here is actually blue-green algae,\u201d\nshe said. Amid the heat the organisms were flourishing and could eventually\nrelease toxins that could harm cattle. \u201cIf a bloom occurs you have to move the\nanimals out of here and find them a new water source,\u201d Ms. Wald said.\n\nLike other ranchers, the Marshalls have bought supplemental feed. But with the\ndrought sending feed prices higher, at some point it makes more financial\nsense to sell animals.\n\nThat has kept auctioneers busy. At a recent sale at Kist Livestock Auction in\nMandan, just across the Missouri River from Bismarck, ranchers in pickup\ntrucks, trailers in tow, lined up to unload cattle they couldn\u2019t afford to\nkeep.\n\nTom Fettig and his wife, Kim, were there with 60 yearlings, about half of a\nherd they were helping their son raise on the outskirts of Bismarck. The\nanimals had been bought in February with the goal of fattening them until\nOctober, when they would be sold to a feedlot.\n\nImage\n\nTom Fettig looking over his family\u2019s steers before they went up for auction at\nthe Kist Livestock Auction in Mandan last month.\n\nImage\n\nBuyers and sellers at the Kist Livestock Auction on July 28.\n\nThe drought ruined those plans. \u201cWe\u2019ve only had them out on pasture since June\n1,\u201d Mr. Fettig said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d\n\nTheir hay crop has been abysmal as well. In a normal year they\u2019d end up with\n800 to 900 bales. So far this year they have only 21.\n\nInside the semicircular auction ring, the Fettigs sat on a bench and waited\nfor their yearlings to come up for sale. They watched as a parade of other\nanimals entered and the auctioneer, Darin Horner, rattled off prices in a\ndroning hum.

2021\n\nAfter \u201cwobbling around,\u201d as the [National Hurricane\nCenter](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/cyclones/) put it late Thursday, Ida on\nFriday resumed a more stable track heading northwest, in effect guided by a\nridge of high-pressure air off the Southeastern United States.\n\nThe ridge was expected to move westward, forecasters said, which should keep\nthe storm on that general track through the weekend, churning across the Gulf\nof Mexico and most likely making landfall in Louisiana late Sunday.\n\nIda had maximum sustained winds of nearly 65 miles per hour midday Friday and\nbecame a Category 1 hurricane, with winds above 73 m.p.h., before making\nlandfall in western Cuba.\n\nThe crucial question, for residents and emergency authorities along the Gulf\nCoast, is how much stronger it will become in the days after it passes Cuba\nand before landfall.\n\nThe hurricane center said that the storm should strengthen steadily into\nSaturday, but after that it could grow much stronger very rapidly. Ida could\nbecome a major hurricane \u2014 defined as Category 3 or higher, with maximum\nsustained winds of at least 111 m.p.h. \u2014 in the 24 hours before landfall.\n\n[Research over the past\ndecade](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08471-z#ref-CR7) has found\nthat, on average, such rapid intensification of hurricanes is increasing, in\npart because the oceans, which provide the energy for hurricanes, are getting\nwarmer as a result of human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nThe hurricane center defines rapid intensification as at least a 35-m.p.h.\nincrease in sustained winds over 24 hours. In the extremely active 2020\nseason, Hurricane Laura intensified by 45 m.p.h. in the 24 hours before making\nlandfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm in late August.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is currently very warm, as it normally is near the end of\nsummer, so there is more energy to fuel Ida. Wind shear, or changes in wind\nspeed and direction, that had been affecting Ida\u2019s cyclonic structure was also\nexpected to dissipate. The storm should then become more organized, which will\nallow it to strengthen more quickly.\n\nThe storm is currently moving at about 15 m.p.h. Other recent research has\nshown an increasing trend in [hurricanes slowing down, or stalling, as they\napproach the coast](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-019-0074-8).\n\nLast September, [Hurricane Sally slowed to about 2 to 3\nm.p.h](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/climate/hurricane-sally-climate-\nchange.html?). as it neared the coast of Alabama. Should Ida slow down, it\nwould likely dump its large amounts of rain over a smaller area, potentially\nmaking flooding worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n", "name": "Ida is expected to gain strength as it churns toward Louisiana.", "date_of_evidence": "20210828", "data": {"RSS Feed": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Climate.xml", "Media_Cloud_ID": 1, "Company Name": "New York Times (Environment)"}, "source": "D5", "date_of_scrape": "20210828", "project": "Climate Change", "scraper": "rss_media"}, {"ref": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/business/ethan-brown-beyond-meat-corner-office.html", "extract": "Ethan Brown, the founder and C.E.O. of Beyond Meat, on his moral and environmental priorities.", "text": "[Business](/section/business)|The \u2018Hedonistic Altruism\u2019 of Plant-Based Meat\n\n[](/)[](/)\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/business/ethan-brown-beyond-meat-corner-\noffice.html\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=9869919170&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Fbusiness%2Fethan-brown-beyond-meat-corner-office.html%3Fsmid%3Dfb-share&name=The%20%E2%80%98Hedonistic%20Altruism%E2%80%99%20of%20Plant-Based%20Meat&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F)\n  * [](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=The%20%E2%80%98Hedonistic%20Altruism%E2%80%99%20of%20Plant-Based%20Meat%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Fbusiness%2Fethan-brown-beyond-meat-corner-office.html%3Fsmid%3Dwa-share)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Fbusiness%2Fethan-brown-beyond-meat-corner-office.html%3Fsmid%3Dtw-share&text=The%20%E2%80%98Hedonistic%20Altruism%E2%80%99%20of%20Plant-Based%20Meat)\n  * [](mailto:?subject=NYTimes.com%3A%20The%20%E2%80%98Hedonistic%20Altruism%E2%80%99%20of%20Plant-Based%20Meat&body=From%20The%20New%20York%20Times%3A%0A%0AThe%20%E2%80%98Hedonistic%20Altruism%E2%80%99%20of%20Plant-Based%20Meat%0A%0AEthan%20Brown%2C%20the%20founder%20and%20C.E.O.%20of%20Beyond%20Meat%2C%20on%20his%20moral%20and%20environmental%20priorities.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Fbusiness%2Fethan-brown-beyond-meat-corner-office.html%3Fsmid%3Dem-share)\n  *   * \n\n![Ethan\nBrown](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/29/business/27CornerOffice-\nBrown/27CornerOffice-Brown-\narticleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale)\n\nEthan BrownCredit...Maggie Shannon for The New York Times\n\nSectionsSkip to contentSkip to site index\n\n[](/)\n\ncorner office\n\n# The \u2018Hedonistic Altruism\u2019 of Plant-Based Meat\n\nEthan Brown, the founder and C.E.O. of Beyond Meat, on his moral and\nenvironmental priorities.\n\nEthan BrownCredit...Maggie Shannon for The New York Times\n\nSupported by\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=9869919170&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Fbusiness%2Fethan-brown-beyond-meat-corner-office.html%3Fsmid%3Dfb-share&name=The%20%E2%80%98Hedonistic%20Altruism%E2%80%99%20of%20Plant-Based%20Meat&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F)\n  * [](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=The%20%E2%80%98Hedonistic%20Altruism%E2%80%99%20of%20Plant-Based%20Meat%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Fbusiness%2Fethan-brown-beyond-meat-corner-office.html%3Fsmid%3Dwa-share)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Fbusiness%2Fethan-brown-beyond-meat-corner-office.html%3Fsmid%3Dtw-share&text=The%20%E2%80%98Hedonistic%20Altruism%E2%80%99%20of%20Plant-Based%20Meat)\n  * [](mailto:?subject=NYTimes.com%3A%20The%20%E2%80%98Hedonistic%20Altruism%E2%80%99%20of%20Plant-Based%20Meat&body=From%20The%20New%20York%20Times%3A%0A%0AThe%20%E2%80%98Hedonistic%20Altruism%E2%80%99%20of%20Plant-Based%20Meat%0A%0AEthan%20Brown%2C%20the%20founder%20and%20C.E.O.%20of%20Beyond%20Meat%2C%20on%20his%20moral%20and%20environmental%20priorities.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F27%2Fbusiness%2Fethan-brown-beyond-meat-corner-office.html%3Fsmid%3Dem-share)\n  *   * \n\n[![David Gelles](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/24/multimedia/author-\ndavid-gelles/author-david-gelles-\nthumbLarge.png)](https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-gelles)\n\nBy [David Gelles](https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-gelles)\n\n  * Aug. 27, 2021\n\nEthan Brown contends there are several main benefits to consuming plant-based\nfoods instead of animal meat. It leads to fewer greenhouse gas emissions, it\nconsumes fewer natural resources and it is better for human health.\n\nBut for Mr. Brown, the founder and chief executive of Beyond Meat, there is a\nmore personal motivator: He would rather not be responsible for the deaths of\nanimals.\n\n\u201cIf you say, \u2018I want to inflict pain and take someone else\u2019s body,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brown\nsaid, \u201cthat is not something I want to do.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown is, of course, talking his own book. His company is now one of the\nbiggest producers of plant-based meat, selling burgers, sausages and more in\nsupermarkets, and supplying its products to fast-food restaurants like\nMcDonald\u2019s and Panda Express.\n\nYet on many fronts, the data backs up Mr. Brown\u2019s claims. Plant-based diets\nare indeed better for the environment and consume fewer natural resources.\nEating more plants is good for human health and results in less harm to\nanimals.\n\nMr. Brown, who became a vegetarian in high school, started Beyond Meat in\n2009, and took the company public in 2019. In recent years, the market for\nplant-based meat has [started\nbooming](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/dining/plant-based-meats-\ncoronavirus.html), with other companies, such as Impossible Foods, competing\nfor those customers. Last year, Beyond Meat sold some 73 million pounds of\nproduct.\n\nBut as the industry grows, it is [coming under\nfire](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/well/eat/fake-meat-vs-real-meat.html)\nfrom the conventional meat industry, which is trying to raise concerns about\nwhat it calls \u201cultraprocessed imitations.\u201d\n\nThis interview was condensed and edited for clarity.\n\n* * *\n\n **What made you choose to be a vegan?**\n\nMy dad grew up in rural parts of the country, and wanted to have that\nexperience. But he married my mother, who was from New York City. The\ncompromise was that we have a place in the city, but they\u2019d have a farm. My\ndad would work during the week, then go up to the country. The experience of\nbeing in nature all the time and being with animals just made me fascinated by\nthe rest of life on Earth. And as I got older, I had trouble making a\ndistinction between my dog and a pig. The vegan thing came from that.\n\n **Humans are omnivores. We evolved to eat other animals.**\n\nYou can talk for hours about why it makes sense for us to eat meat. We\u2019ve\nalways done it. Everyone else in the animal kingdom does it. But you have this\nunavoidable thing \u2014 you\u2019re causing pain. Do you want to do that?\n\nWhat\u2019s different between an animal and a person? To me, the one difference\nthat I can understand is that we can understand the consequences of our\nactions. While my dog can\u2019t make sense of inflicting pain on another animal, I\ncertainly can.\n\n **What led you to start the company?**\n\nI struggled a lot with taking what we just talked about into my professional\nlife. I kept it separate, and I got into climate because I care a lot about\nthe Earth. Coming out of college, I had a very important conversation with my\ndad, where I was talking about what to do in my life. He asked me, \u201cSo what\u2019s\nthe biggest problem in the world?\u201d I thought about it a little bit and went to\nclimate. So I was working for a fuel cell company, and it was great. But as I\nstarted to understand better the emissions implications of livestock, I\nwondered if you could do something disruptive in agriculture.\n\nYou can focus on one thing, which is to simply change the protein, and have a\nreal impact on four global issues that fascinate me: the climate, natural\nresources, animal welfare and human health.\n\n **How is a Beyond Burger healthier for me than a hamburger?**\n\nA No. 1 priority for us is to make sure people understand that our products\nare actually better for them than animal protein.\n\nDaily Business Briefing\n\n## [Latest Updates](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/27/business/economy-\nstock-market-news)\n\nUpdated\n\nAug. 27, 2021, 8:54 p.m. ET\n\n  * [Amazon strikes a deal with Affirm, the buy-now pay-later provider.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/27/business/economy-stock-market-news#amazon-affirm)\n  * [The Pulitzer Board awards a citation and $100,000 to Afghan journalists at risk.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/27/business/economy-stock-market-news#the-pulitzer-board-awards-a-citation-and-100000-to-afghan-journalists-at-risk)\n  * [The White House projects that inflation and economic growth will rise this year.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/27/business/economy-stock-market-news#biden-economy-inflation)\n\nWe started working with Stanford School of Medicine, and a professor designed\na study to test what happened if people consumed three servings of animal\nprotein a day for eight weeks, and then switched for eight weeks to three\nservings of Beyond Meat. The results were amazing, and they were expected. We\nsaw both statistically and clinically significant drops in LDL cholesterol,\nwhich is the bad cholesterol. The second indicator was around TMAO, which is a\ncompound that forms in the gut that is very closely associated with heart\ndisease. And we saw both clinically and statistically significant drops in\nTMAO levels. We want to do more of this. We want to generate more data, with\nlarger populations.\n\nWe also have to educate people about the cleanliness of our process. You could\ncome to any of our facilities at any time, knock on the door, and I\u2019ll give\nyou a tour. You cannot do that at a meat-processing facility. They won\u2019t let\nyou. That speaks volumes.\n\n **Not everyone is so convinced that plant-based burgers are healthy. I\nmentioned Beyond burgers the other day and someone started talking about all\nthe chemicals.**\n\nIf you were to list out the chemical composition of organic Kobe beef it would\nbe a superlong list of really long, complicated words that most of us couldn\u2019t\npronounce. All the amino acids, all the different lactic acids, all of the\ncomponents that go into having a piece of muscle stay together in an animal\u2019s\nbody. We don\u2019t have the luxury of just saying \u201cplant-based beef.\u201d So we have\nto list out our ingredients. But it\u2019s not like there\u2019s more ingredients in\nours than there is in actual muscle if you break down the chemistry.\n\nWe have a very large, incumbent industry that knows this is a big issue for\nus. There was a full-page ad in The New York Times that took all the products\nin the category and listed all the gnarliest ingredients and said, \u201cThis is\nwhat\u2019s in plant-based meat.\u201d So it\u2019s being ginned up. Competitive interests\nare creating a lot of attention around this issue.\n\n **Is the meat industry out to get you?**\n\nNo. Tyson owned part of our company for a while. It\u2019s a $1.4 trillion-dollar\nindustry, and I think they\u2019re doing pretty well right now. If you look at our\nsales this year, they\u2019re good, but they\u2019re very small compared to the meat\nindustry. So I think there are pockets that are kind of antagonistic, but not\nas a whole.\n\n **How is Beyond Meat different from Impossible Foods?**\n\nIt gets down to ingredient choices. I believe that everything you need to\nbuild a piece of meat perfectly from plants is already in nature, and you just\nhave to look hard enough to find it. Impossible is taking a different\napproach. They\u2019re genetically modifying ingredients. And we\u2019re just not going\nto do that.\n\n **How do you reconcile all your fast-food partnerships with your emphasis on\nhealth?**\n\nI love those customers, and I think it\u2019s about making incremental gains. If\nit\u2019s being fried, obviously it\u2019s fried. But if you look at the underlying\ncharacteristics of the product \u2014 the cholesterol levels, the saturated fat\nlevels \u2014 are you getting a gain? And you are, in many cases. It\u2019s progress.\n\n **Is it an uncomfortable alliance for you, though?**\n\nI cherish those relationships. I think there\u2019s a changing of guard that\u2019s\noccurring at a lot of these companies, and these are people that really want\nto serve healthier products and want to bring the consumer along. There\u2019s a\nreal genuine desire there to continue to improve the health profile of their\nmenus. I think it\u2019s sincere.\n\n **You don\u2019t lean into the climate-change angle in your marketing. But given\nthe year we\u2019re all having across the world, why not?**\n\nThere\u2019s a term that we use here called \u201chedonistic altruism.\u201d I\u2019m going to try\nto create products that help people feel better about themselves, but also\nconfer benefits to the world, versus obligating someone to eat something\nbecause it\u2019s good for the world.\n\nPresident Carter\u2019s position on energy use was to take the bus. Elon Musk comes\nalong, and he\u2019s like, \u201cMake a sexy car that people want to drive.\u201d That\u2019s a\nsolution people are going to get behind if they can afford it. So it\u2019s always\nabout how do you get people to understand that the product is going to make\nthem feel better, look better, have a better health outcome and, hey, there\u2019s\na halo effect with climate, natural resources, animal welfare. But trying to\nget people to eat something based on climate is hard to understand.\n\n **Are there parts of being a public company that you\u2019re trying to do\ndifferently, in the same way that you\u2019re interrogating our food system?**\n\nGoing public is awesome, but there\u2019s some challenges that go along with it.\nYou make a deal, and the deal is worth it, in my view. But the short-term\npressure is real. We\u2019re trying to build a long-term business that someday is\ngoing to rival Tyson in jobs and in global scale, and we also have to think\nabout quarterly outcomes. That\u2019s a really difficult tension.\n\nOften, I\u2019m just more focused on those long-term outcomes, and I **** have to\nput on blinders, because everyone is so interested in what\u2019s happening in a\nparticular quarter, and it\u2019s really irrelevant from the perspective of long-\nterm growth of the business. That is very real, and something that\u2019s wrong\nwith our system that we need to try to fix.\n\n **There were some news reports on a bunch of** **[patent\napplications](https://vegnews.com/2021/8/beyond-meat-trademarks)** **recently.\nAre we going to see Beyond eggs and milk and all the rest?**\n\nI can\u2019t say, but I saw those articles, too. Once you start thinking about\nprotein that doesn\u2019t have to come from an animal, you can extend that \u2014 you\ncan go into other categories that use animal products. And we have a broad\nbreadth of potential categories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n", "name": "The \u2018Hedonistic Altruism\u2019 of Plant-Based Meat", "date_of_evidence": "20210827", "data": {"RSS Feed": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Climate.xml", "Media_Cloud_ID": 1, "Company Name": "New York Times (Environment)"}, "source": "D5", "date_of_scrape": "20210828", "project": "Climate Change", "scraper": "rss_media"}]

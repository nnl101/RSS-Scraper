In general, regional health authorities tend to be more forthcoming\nwith this data. (CBC)\n\nBut being large and densely populated also gives Peel resources.\n\nIts health unit is led by Dr. Lawrence Loh, who has been praised for taking on\nAmazon and ordering the shutdown of workplaces despite furious resistance. He\nalso has a large team of epidemiologists well versed in data analytics.\n\n\"We recognized very early on that sharing data, particularly around things\nlike occupation, could actually help develop a clear picture of how the\npandemic is unfolding in our community and also allow us to identify areas\nthat may require attention,\" said Loh.\n\nA recently published map showing vaccination rates by postal code is helping\nthe region be more strategic in its vaccine rollout, he added.\n\n\"So that's why we have pop-up clinics in these locations,\" he said. \"That's\nwhy we have community agencies and partnerships. To actually get in there.\"\n\nIt was this data that allowed Indus to lobby the Ontario government, receiving\n$750,000 as part of the province's High Priority Communities Strategy. The\ngroup mounted a media campaign in several Indian languages, including Hindi\nand Punjabi. They hired people to knock on doors, help with vaccine\nappointments and dispel myths about vaccines among those hesitant. They\nrallied community leaders to talk to people at community halls and houses of\nworship.\n\n![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.6063073.1623454686!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/gfx-\nweb-chart-rocha-data-vaccines-png.png)\n\nGovernments are more forthcoming with data on vaccines, but not all track how\nmany people received one or both doses.

(Birinder Narang)\n\nLike other provinces, British Columbia does not collect ethnicity data on\nCOVID-19 infections or immunizations. The best Narang could hope for was\ncommunity-level data that could be cross-referenced with five-year-old census\ndata on ethnicity.\n\nIt took B.C. more than a year to release even localized information \u2014 and it\nonly did so after a data leak proved the provincial government was collecting\nit. It showed significantly higher rates of COVID-19 in the Metro Vancouver\nneighbourhoods home to the highest proportions of South Asians and recent\nimmigrants.\n\nHad the province released this data sooner, Narang said the response from\npublic health and local community groups would likely have looked a lot more\nlike Peel's.\n\n\"Outreach and targeted messaging within the media \u2014 culturally specific,\nculturally relevant messaging \u2014 and much more targeted vaccination in hotspot\ncommunities much earlier in the campaign.\"\n\n## Privacy, stigmatization concerns\n\nThe most common reasons health officials gave for not releasing such\ninformation were privacy concerns and the potential of stigmatization for\naffected communities.\n\nThe Manitoba government released a report on the ethnic breakdown of COVID-19\ncases in its province, but does not provide that data by geographical area or\nas part of daily releases.\n\n\"Manitoba's population is much smaller than that of larger jurisdictions, and\nsome of the Prairie clich\u00e9s of everyone knowing each other have some truth to\nit,\" the press secretary to the province's health ministry said in an email.\n\n![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.6061095.1623355085!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/khalsa-\ndarbar-covid-vaccine-clinic.jpg)\n\nNurses with Switch Health administer doses of the Pfizer vaccine at the\nOntario Khalsa Darbar, a Sikh Gurudwara in Mississauga, Ont. (Evan Mitsui)\n\n\"Throughout the pandemic, we have preached the need to avoid stigmatization,\nas it is an ally of the virus.\"\n\nIn Manitoba, this is particularly true with respect to Indigenous communities.\nBoth the federal and Manitoba governments provide data on infection and\nimmunization rates among Indigenous people, but it isn't community specific.\n\nIn some parts of the country, notably B.C., Indigenous leaders have had to\nfight to get timely information about infections in nearby areas, again due to\nconcerns around privacy and stigma.\n\nPeel's top doctor argues that data can, in fact, counter stigma. Early in the\npandemic, when Peel had high case rates, there was widespread assumption that\nthe region's population wasn't following public health directives.\n\n\"We were able to come out and say, it's not that people aren't following the\nregulations, it's in fact the fact that these people are working in jobs that\ncannot be done from home,\" Loh said.\n\n\"It's not the data itself that leads to the stigma and discrimination, but it\nis the inability to understand the full story behind the numbers.\"\n\n![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.5569985.1623356051!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-\nkwame-mckenzie.jpg)\n\nDr. Kwame McKenzie is CEO of the Wellesley Institute, a Toronto-based think-\ntank that advises on policy for more equitable health care in urban\ncommunities.

And that's interesting to\nme.\"\n\nB.C. is approaching Stage 2 of its reopening plan as early as June 15, which\nwill allow up to 50 people to gather for indoor events, including live\ntheatre, with safety protocols in place.\n\nDespite some loosening restrictions, Parasram, who moved to Vancouver from\nToronto in 2018, suspects that theatre companies in both provinces will still\nfavour outdoor venues \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\"Even just being in the same room, there's going to be a whole level of\nanxiety for some people who are there. And that level of anxiety is going to\nbe hard to engage with the piece and things will be missed,\" he said.\n\nBut he said that the arts can contribute greatly to \"community wellness.\"\n\n\"Relearning what it means to be in a space together, that's a big role that we\ncan play.\"\n\n## Headed back to Broadway\n\nIn March 2020, the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical _Hadestown_ played for\nfull houses eight times a week at Broadway's Walter Kerr Theatre, before\nCOVID-19 shut it down.\n\nOne of the actors whose life was upended is Jewelle Blackman, who returned to\nToronto, moved back in with her parents and turned to writing songs and plays\nto cope with the \"trauma and distraught of theatre being gone.\"\n\n\"I knew that, right now, I couldn't rely on the aspect of me performing to be\nwhat carried me through this pandemic,\" she said.\n\nShe came up with a show called _A Crack in the Wall_ , co-written with\nEvangelia Kambites, about love, loss and life during the pandemic. The duo\nwill perform it for an audience of 10 people as part of The Musical Stage\nCompany's _Porchside Songs_ series.\n\nIt will be the first time Blackman will have sung live since last March. She\nsaid she is frustrated by how slowly theatre is recovering compared to other\nsectors.\n\nRecently on a film set in Toronto, Blackman noticed a stark contrast between\nthat environment and the performing arts.\n\n\"Every three days, they do a rapid test and you get your results pretty\nquickly. Before they yell, 'Shoot!', everybody still has their masks on.\nEverybody in the room. And then it's only the actors who take their masks off\nwhile shooting,\" she explained.\n\nBut now that Broadway is back, Blackman will return to New York at the end of\nJuly in preparation for _Hadestown_ 's reopening on Sept. 2. She said she is\nlooking forward to her first show.\n\n\"I don't know how long we'll all be crying, or yelling, or whatever. It's\ngoing to be a moment.\"\n\n", "name": "Canada is slowly reopening, but is live theatre being left behind? 3 insiders weigh in", "date_of_evidence": "20210613", "data": {"RSS Feed": "https://www.cbc.ca/cmlink/rss-topstories", "Media_Cloud_ID": 7333, "Company Name": "CBC"}, "source": "D5", "date_of_scrape": "20210614", "project": "Climate Change", "scraper": "rss_media"}, {"ref": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-g7-commitments-1.6064143?cmp=rss", "extract": "<img src='https://i.cbc.ca/1.6064253.1623602098!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_460/g7-trudeau-20210613.jpg' alt='G7 Trudeau 20210613' width='460' title='Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau walks on stage at a news conference at Tregenna Castle following the G7 Summit in St. Ives, Cornwall, England, on Sunday, June 13, 2021.' height='259' />                <p>As part of a joint communiqu\u00e9 issued at the close of the G7 meeting in the U.K., Canada has made commitments on climate action and COVID-19, including financing or donating 100 million vaccine doses to developing nations.</p>", "text": "The G7 Summit has wrapped up with pledges from world leaders to take urgent\naction on the COVID-19 pandemic, climate and possibly China.\n\nThe world's leading democracies have committed, in a 25-page communiqu\u00e9, to\nending the pandemic and preparing for the future, as well as supporting a\ngreen revolution while dragging their economies toward recovery.\n\nOn the issue of China, other than taking a hard line on respect for human\nrights, the language was decidedly and unexpectedly cool, given the rhetoric\nbefore and during the gathering in the English seaside community of Carbis\nBay.\n\nThere is a reference to giving the developing world a safe, affordable\ninfrastructure alternative to Chinese financing but it does not appear as\nstrong as the United States might have wanted.\n\nThe Group of Seven leaders also pledged to share more coronavirus vaccines\nwith countries in need over the next year \u2014 up to two billion doses including\ncontributions made since February 2021, the final communiqu\u00e9 said on Sunday.\n\nCanada's share is 100 million doses, a target signalled by the Liberal\ngovernment at the onset of the three-day summit.\n\n![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.6064254.1623602127!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/g7-trudeau-20210613.jpg)\n\nTrudeau responds to a question during the news conference.

Any residual garbage like antenna, stray legs\nand dirt were rinsed away down the drain and then I freeze-dried them to add\nthat extra crisp and crunch. Last step is to saut\u00e9 them over medium-high heat\nwith the below recipe.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nCicadas (As many as you can catch)  \n5 ml (1 tsp.) salt  \n5 ml (1 tsp.) olive oil  \n2.5 ml (\u00bd tsp.) black pepper  \n2 cloves of garlic, roasted and chopped  \n15 ml (1 Tbsp.) tablespoon shallots diced  \n15 ml (1Tbsp.) fresh herbs (parsley, chives, basil)\n\n## Cicada avocado toast\n\nBy Elise Harris\n\n**For cicadas:**\n\n15 ml (1 Tbsp.) olive oil  \n15 ml (1 Tbsp.) shallots  \n5 ml (1 tsp.) roasted garlic  \n15 ml (1 Tbsp.) fresh herbs (parsley, chives)  \nSalt and pepper to taste\n\n**For avocado spread:**\n\n1 small firm avocado  \n15 ml (1 Tbsp.) fresh lemon juice  \n15 ml (1 Tbsp.) lemon zest  \n15 ml (1 Tbsp.) fresh chives  \nKosher salt to taste  \nCracked black pepper to taste  \n3 garlic cloves, roasted and smashed  \n1 roma tomato, sliced and oven-roasted  \nEdible flowers  \n2 slices of multigrain bread, toasted\n\n**Directions**\n\n1\\.

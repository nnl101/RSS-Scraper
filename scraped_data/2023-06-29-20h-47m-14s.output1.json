While it is jarring to\nimagine a world in which such a protection would be necessary in very blue New\nYork, it falls in line with efforts in other blue and purple \u2014 and even some\nred \u2014 states post- _Dobbs_ , as the rogue Supreme Court signals that other\nprivacy-related rights may also be at risk.\n\nBut New York Democrats are also taking political lessons from other states\nthat have witnessed the energizing power of abortion for the party in\nelections since _Roe\u2019s_ overturning and are viewing the ballot measure as a\ntool to boost Democrats\u2019 chances of retaking the House.\n\nA coalition of left-leaning groups led by the New Yorkers for Equal Rights\ncollectively pledged $20 million to support the ballot initiative efforts on\nThursday. Other members of the coalition include the NAACP of New York and the\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund, according to\n[Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/29/new-york-dems-put-\nabortion-on-the-ballot-00104285). New Yorkers for Equal Rights said the groups\nwere inspired by the success Michigan Democrats saw in the midterms when\nvoters were presented with a ballot initiative that would codify abortion\nrights into the state constitution. The amendment passed, Democrats secured a\ntrifecta for the first time in four decades and many vulnerable Democrats held\nonto their seats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a ton from our colleagues around the country, including our\ncolleagues in Michigan,\u201d campaign director for New Yorkers for Equal Rights\nSasha Neha Ahuja told Politico. \u201cIt was incredibly successful, and similar to\nNew York in that there was support for this ballot measure across party lines.\nIt was really popular for candidates to stand with and encourage people to\nvote yes on the referendum.\u201d\n\nThe group believes the ballot measure could bring about a similar scenario in\nNew York where energized turnout in support of the measure could also help\nDemocrats win back some key swing districts currently held by Republicans\n(like, Rep. George Santos\u2019 seat, for example) and boost efforts to retake the\nHouse.\n\nIn a [memo](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000189-08ac-d8b7-a9bb-\neeef47610000) explaining the investment, the groups spelled out that plan\nrather explicitly as a key prong of its goals for the funding:\n\n> 2\\. Unite independent, moderate and liberal voters with women voters and\n> voters of color in the areas that saw a decline in Democratic performance\n> between 2020 and 2022, particularly in the New York City region and in\n> Westchester, Ulster, Albany, and Tompkins counties.\n>\n> 3\\. Aggressively reaching out to voters across the political spectrum in\n> Nassau, Suffolk, Erie, Onondaga, Monroe, and several Hudson Valley counties,\n> most notably Rockland, to reverse declines from 2022.\n\nWhile the effort has taken some time to catch on, Democrats may actually be\nembracing the edge they hold when it comes to public opinion on abortion\nheading into 2024.\n\n## The Best Of TPM Today\n\nHere\u2019s what you should read this evening:\n\n[Supreme Court Justices Get Unusually Personal In Landmark Affirmative Action\nCase](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/supreme-court-affirmative-action-\nsotomayor-thomas)\n\n[Florida Men Charged With Insider Trading Ahead of Truth Social\nLaunch](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/three-truth-social-funders-charged-\nin-insider-trading-case)\n\n[DeSantis Camp Puts Longtime Right-Wing Effort To Demolish Fed Govt Front And\nCenter](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/desantis-camp-puts-longtime-right-\nwing-effort-to-demolish-fed-govt-front-and-center)\n\n[Conservative Supreme Court Majority Restricts Affirmative Action, Overturning\nDecades Of Precedent](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/supreme-court-\naffirmative-action)\n\nICYMI: [Ep. 279: Moore Good News From\nSCOTUS](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/podcasts/the-josh-marshall-\npodcast/ep-279-moore-good-news-from-scotus/)\n\n## Yesterday\u2019s Most Read Story\n\n[It Was A Big Day In Trump Accountability\nWorld](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/morning-memo/it-was-a-big-day-in-trump-\naccountability-world) \u2014 David Kurtz\n\n## What We Are Reading\n\n[Americans in former Confederate states more likely to say violent protest\nagainst government is justified, 160 years after\nGettysburg](https://theconversation.com/americans-in-former-confederate-\nstates-more-likely-to-say-violent-protest-against-government-is-\njustified-160-years-after-gettysburg-208425) \u2014 The Conversation\n\n[Jan. 6 participant, identified nearly two years ago, is arrested near Obama\nhome](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jan-6-participant-\nidentified-nearly-two-years-ago-arrested-obama-resid-rcna91915) \u2014 NBC\n\n[Why Donald Trump Was So Mad at Mark Milley That He Confessed to a\nCrime](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/why-\ndonald-trump-was-so-mad-at-mark-milley-that-he-confessed-to-a-crime) \u2014 New\nYorker\n\n", "name": "Where Things Stand: New York Dems Push Abortion Ballot Initiative In Hopes It\u2019ll Help Retake House", "date_of_evidence": "20230629", "data": {"RSS Feed": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/feed/atom", "Media_Cloud_ID": 113, "Company Name": "Talking Points Memo"}, "source": "D5", "date_of_scrape": "20230629", "project": "Climate Change", "scraper": "rss_media"}, {"ref": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/history-logic-and-the-court", "extract": "Let me share a few brief and general thoughts on today&#8217;s decision.

But step\nback and you see that a specific class of Americans who were enslaved for two\ncenturies and then mostly lived under a system of legal apartheid for another\ncentury somehow still remain largely excluded from social and economic\npreferment. And we\u2019re told that the constitution not only bars the government\nfrom doing anything about that but also bars private institutions from\nattempting to do anything about that. Judged from that more holistic\nperspective it\u2019s very hard to see how that can possibly be right whatever the\ninternal logic of \u201ccolor blindness.\u201d\n\nSecond, the same people who wrote the amendments that undergird this decision\nalso passed various laws specifically to raise Black social and economic power\nto the level of white people. So the Court\u2019s definition of \u201ccolor blindness\u201d\nsimply cannot have been the intent of the authors of the amendment. The\nhistory is open and shut.\n\nThird, the question of whether the constitution requires or looks favorably on\nracial diversity is a complex question and it\u2019s not entirely clear that it\ndoes, at least if we\u2019re limiting our analysis tightly to the intent of the\npeople who wrote the relevant amendments. But if originalism or history plays\nany role in your jurisprudence, African-Americans represent a unique class\nwhich the constitution specifically intends to raise to the level of white\npeople. One could argue that that task is done somehow, or that society has\nchanged in some respect that makes the original injunction operate differently\nor that affirmative and compensatory educational preferment is somehow\nuniquely damaging and thus a disallowed means of achieving that aim. But\nagain, specifically for African-Americans, the \u201ccolor blindness\u201d\nconstitutional argument doesn\u2019t add up.\n\n", "name": "History, Logic and the Court", "date_of_evidence": "20230629", "data": {"RSS Feed": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/feed/atom", "Media_Cloud_ID": 113, "Company Name": "Talking Points Memo"}, "source": "D5", "date_of_scrape": "20230629", "project": "Climate Change", "scraper": "rss_media"}, {"ref": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/listen-to-this-moore-good-news-from-scotus", "extract": "A new episode of The Josh Marshall Podcast is live!

Every\njustice except Amy Coney Barrett, Samuel Alito and Elena Kagan wrote\nindependently.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the primary dissent, taking particular aim at\nJustice Clarence Thomas.\n\n\u201cHe first renews his argument that the use of race in holistic admissions\nleads to the \u2018inevitable\u2019 \u2018underperformance\u2019 by Black and Latino students at\nelite universities \u2018because they are less academically prepared than the white\nand Asian students with whom they must compete,\u2019\u201d she wrote, citing Thomas\u2019\nargument in his concurrence. \u201cJustice Thomas speaks only for himself.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the only episode of intra-bench fire.

Chief Justice John Roberts, in his\nmajority opinion, called Sotomayor\u2019s view of the role of the judiciary\n\u201cremarkably wrong.\u201d Gorsuch accused the liberal justices of \u201cdenying reality\u201d\nin what he described as their refusal to acknowledge that race-conscious\nadmissions programs hurt some applicants.\n\nBut one criticism may still sting more than the rest, as Sotomayor hammered\nmore than touched a nerve. In addressing the decades of precedent her right-\nwing colleagues have now overturned, she accused them \u2014 the coterie\nperpetually insisting that they call balls and strikes, that they are\nnonpartisan and non-political, robe-shrouded robots who rise above the fray \u2014\nof flexing the power of the conservative bloc to achieve their preferred\npolicy outcomes.\n\n\u201cLost arguments are not grounds to overrule a case,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen\nproponents of those arguments, greater now in number on the Court, return to\nfight old battles anew, it betrays an unrestrained disregard for precedent.\u201d\n\nShe put an even finer point on the argument.\n\n\u201cAt bottom, the six unelected members of today\u2019s majority upend the status quo\nbased on their policy preferences about what race in America should be like,\nbut is not, and their preferences for a veneer of colorblindness in a society\nwhere race has always mattered and continues to matter in fact and in law,\u201d\nshe concluded.\n\n", "name": "Supreme Court Justices Get Unusually Personal In Landmark Affirmative Action Case", "date_of_evidence": "20230629", "data": {"RSS Feed": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/feed/atom", "Media_Cloud_ID": 113, "Company Name": "Talking Points Memo"}, "source": "D5", "date_of_scrape": "20230629", "project": "Climate Change", "scraper": "rss_media"}, {"ref": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/three-truth-social-funders-charged-in-insider-trading-case", "extract": "Tucked into an announcement about three other insider trading cases, Manhattan federal prosecutors\u00a0said on Thursday\u00a0that they had brought indictments against...", "text": "Tucked into an announcement about three other insider trading cases, Manhattan\nfederal prosecutors[ said on Thursday](https://www.justice.gov/usao-\nsdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-charges-four-separate-insider-trading-cases-\nagainst-10) that they had brought indictments against three men who allegedly\nwrongfully capitalized on confidential information related to the launch of\nPresident Trump\u2019s social media venture Truth Social.\n\nProsecutors with the Southern District of New York obtained an\n[indictment](https://www.justice.gov/media/1303011/dl?inline), also made\npublic today, for three investors over insider trading in the effort to take\nthe Trump social media venture public.\n\nOne of the three charged \u2014 Bruce Garelick \u2014 served on the board of Digital\nWorld Acquisition Corp.

Both employees\npurportedly bought thousands of DWAC warrants each, and spread the information\nto friends and family.\n\nA Trump spokesperson posted a press released on Twitter on Oct. 20 announcing\nthe deal.\n\nAfter that, prosecutors said, the trio sold their shares.\n\nProsecutors said that Michael Shvartsman sold the shares for a whopping $18.2\nmillion from the sales, while Gerald received $4.6 million.

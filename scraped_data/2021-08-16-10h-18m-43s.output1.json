The\npaper was published [Friday in the journal Science\nAdvances](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/33/eabi8789).\n\nExposure to smoke, whether from air pollution or cigarette smoke, is believed\nto impair the function of white blood cells in the lungs, blunting the body\u2019s\nimmune response. The chemicals in particulate matter can also inflame cells\nlining the airways and lungs. In both cases, if the body is exposed to a virus\nin addition to air pollution, the immune response may be slowed and the person\nmay develop a more severe illness than they would have otherwise, researchers\nsay.\n\nThe findings build on the well-established connection between air pollution\nand respiratory-tract infections and conditions such as asthma. But the study\nis the first to show a statistical link between wildfire smoke and Covid-19\ncaseloads and deaths.\n\n\u201cThese results provide strong evidence that, in many counties, the high levels\nof PM 2.5 that occurred during the 2020 wildfires substantially exacerbated\nthe health burden of Covid-19,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nSome places experienced levels of air pollution that were dangerously high. In\nSeptember 2020, Mono County, Calif., had four days where PM 2.5 levels\nexceeded 500 micrograms per cubic meter, a \u201chazardous\u201d level, according to the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. By comparison, on days when wildfires were\nnot burning, the average daily level in the three states was 6 micrograms per\ncubic meter.\n\n[![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/09/us/wildfire-tracker-static-\npromo/wildfire-tracker-static-promo-articleLarge-v9.jpg)\n\n## Track Wildfires in the West\n\nExplore maps of wildfires and air quality in California, Oregon, Washington\nand surrounding states.\n\n](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/wildfires-air-quality-\ntracker.html)\n\nTo arrive at their conclusion, the researchers used satellite data of smoke\nplumes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to identify\nthe locations and days affected by wildfires. They paired those readings with\nPM 2.5 data from ground-level air quality monitors in each of the counties and\nCovid-19 cases and death rates from data compiled by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\n\nTheir statistical model accounted for other factors such as weather and the\namount of time people were at home, and included a four-week lag to capture\nthe virus\u2019s incubation period as well as the additional time it can take for\ninfected people\u2019s health to deteriorate.\n\nThe same team of Harvard researchers [also published the first\nstudy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/climate/air-pollution-coronavirus-\ncovid.html) to find a clear connection between long-term exposure to air\npollution and Covid-19 death rates last year.\n\nThe new study included reported infections, not just deaths, which makes it\nespecially interesting, said John Balmes, a professor of medicine at the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco, and an expert on the health effects\nof pollution who was not involved in the research. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for air\npollution to be increasing the severity of the coronavirus infection, it\u2019s\nanother for it to be increasing reported cases,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter decades of tightening air quality regulations, the air in many American\ncities is cleaner now than it\u2019s been in 50 years. But in the West, increased\nwildfire smoke threatens to undo those advances, said Loretta Mickley, an\natmospheric chemist at Harvard\u2019s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and\nApplied Sciences and one of the paper\u2019s authors.\n\nAs the planet warms, droughts intensify and the West becomes drier, wildfires\nare starting earlier, growing larger, spreading faster and reaching higher\nelevations. In California alone, a record 2.5 million acres burned during the\n2020 wildfire season, 20 times what had burned the previous year.\n\n\u201cWe are really talking about climate change,\u201d said Francesca Dominici, a\nbiostatistician at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and senior\nauthor of the paper. \u201cI hope that this is providing an additional piece of\nevidence for why it\u2019s important to get our act together to combat climate\nchange.\u201d\n\nWildfire smoke may contribute up to half of the PM 2.5 in some parts of the\nwestern United States. It is so far unclear whether wildfire smoke is more or\nless toxic than smoke from diesel combustion or power plants.\n\nDr. Dominici noted that the analysis did not include individual patient data\nor consider other factors such as mask mandates.\n\nResearchers are currently investigating whether fine particulate matter can\nspread the coronavirus.\n\nThe research does not bode well for this year, Dr. Dominici said, as wildfires\nstarted early and the pandemic is still raging in the United States, with a\nDelta variant that tends to be more contagious. She added: \u201cI think the\nwildfires will have the same, if not worse impact on Covid-19 cases and deaths\namong the unvaccinated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n", "name": "In the West, a Connection Between Covid and Wildfires", "date_of_evidence": "20210814", "data": {"RSS Feed": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/EnergyEnvironment.xml", "Media_Cloud_ID": 1, "Company Name": "New York Times (Energy)"}, "source": "D5", "date_of_scrape": "20210816", "project": "Climate Change", "scraper": "rss_media"}, {"ref": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/climate/republicans-climate-change.html", "extract": "Many Republicans in Congress no longer deny that Earth is heating because of fossil fuel emissions.

A [Pew Research Center\nsurvey](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-\nstand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/) in\nMay found just 10 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning independents\nwere deeply concerned with addressing climate change, while a majority thought\nPresident Biden\u2019s ambitious plans to curb climate change would hurt the\neconomy.\n\nWith the exception of [young Republicans who have been\nagitating](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/climate/climate-could-be-an-\nelectoral-time-bomb-republican-strategists-fear.html) for their party to take\nclimate change more seriously, conservative voters as a whole have not shifted\nmuch on the issue over the past 10 years. That skepticism may have reached a\npinnacle with President Donald J. Trump, who famously derided climate science,\n[loosened emissions rules and expanded oil and gas drilling on public\nlands](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-\nrollbacks-list.html).\n\nImage\n\nSenator Rick Scott of Florida said he wants to address climate change, but\n\u201cyou can\u2019t do it where you\u2019re killing jobs.\u201dCredit...Michael A. McCoy for The\nNew York Times\n\nBut as the impacts of global warming become more apparent with [each weather\nforecast](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/13/us/climate-change), the\nmessage from Republicans and their allies has shifted. They now argue for\ninvestment in research and development, or technological solutions that are\nyears away from viability, such as cleaning the air after oil, gas and coal\nare burned. Many also favor expanding nuclear energy, which does not produce\ngreenhouse gases but poses other challenges including the lengthy time it\ntakes to build new plants and concerns about disposal of spent fuel and risk\nof radioactive leaks.\n\nA few Republicans, like Senator Mitt Romney of Utah and Lindsey Graham of\nSouth Carolina, have said they support charging companies for the carbon\ndioxide they generate, a strategy that economists say would create a powerful\nincentive to lower emissions. But neither man is championing such a measure\nwith any urgency.\n\nThe majority of Republican lawmakers back less aggressive responses popular\nwith their voters, like planting trees to absorb more carbon dioxide from the\natmosphere, or offering tax credits to businesses that capture carbon dioxide\nafter it has been released into the air by power plants or industrial sites.\n\n\u201cWhat they are opposing is any program to meaningfully reduce emissions,\u201d said\nDavid G. Victor, co-director of the Deep Decarbonization Initiative at the\nUniversity of California, San Diego.\n\nSenator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana helped craft the $1 trillion infrastructure\npackage that the Senate passed this week, and made sure it included billions\nof dollars to protect coastal states from sea level rise caused by climate\nchange. But Mr. Cassidy said he won\u2019t support policies to curb the amount of\noil that is drilled off the Louisiana coast \u2014 the burning of which is\ncontributing to melting ice caps and rising seas.\n\n\u201cWe cannot live without fossil fuels or chemicals, period, end of story,\u201d said\nMr. Cassidy, who wants to expand exports of liquefied natural gas, which is\nproduced in Louisiana and emits half the carbon dioxide of coal but is a\nsource of methane, a greenhouse gas even more potent in the short term.\n\nAnd while Senator Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, allowed that\n[climate change is driving the extreme\ndrought](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/climate/drought.html) that has\ndevastated crops and decimated livestock in his state this summer, he said the\ngases produced by burning fossil fuels should be the target, not the fuels\nthemselves.\n\n\u201cWe need to be on an anti-carbon mission, not an anti-fuel mission,\u201d said Mr.\nCramer, whose state is also a top oil and gas producer.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican, said it made no sense for the\nUnited States to cut its emissions while other countries like China continue\nto pollute. But at the same time, he also rejected trade policies that would\napply pressure on China and others to curb their emissions.\n\nImage\n\nSenator James Inhofe of Oklahoma brought a snowball to the Senate floor in\n2015 to support his erroneous claim that the planet is not getting\nhotter.Credit...CSPAN.org\n\nStill, the fact that Republicans recognize emissions as a problem marks\nprogress, however incremental, said Tom Moyer, the Utah state coordinator for\nthe Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby, which is trying to build bipartisan support for a\ntax on carbon dioxide emissions. \u201cThey\u2019re small bites at a solution, but it\u2019s\nso much more than we could have gotten even a few years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd\nhopefully the trend continues.\u201d\n\nMitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, [said of climate change last\nSeptember, ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN88FneY63I)\u201cI concur that it is\nhappening and it is a problem. The argument is about how to best address it.\u201d\n\nSenator John Cornyn of oil and gas-rich Texas said in a July interview, \u201cI\nhave no doubt the climate is changing and people contribute to it.\u201d Senator\nRichard Shelby of Alabama said he thinks weather disasters simply happen, yet\n\u201ca lot of it, I\u2019m sure, with all the stuff we put in the air, is self-made.\u201d\n\nEven Senator James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who famously once threw a\nsnowball on the Senate floor to claim the planet is not getting hotter,\ninsisted last month that he never called climate change a \u201choax,\u201d only that\nthe dire consequences have been overblown. (Mr. Inhofe is the author of a book\nentitled \u201cThe Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your\nFuture.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to look like they are denying the science, but they don\u2019t\nwant to look like they\u2019re anti-free market and support regulation,\u201d said\nMichael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at\nPrinceton University. \u201cBut the fact is, there\u2019s no way to solve this without\nregulating and mandating the cut of emissions. There\u2019s no magical easy\n\u2018innovation-only\u2019 way out of this.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say the tools exist now to stave off a hotter planet: rapidly expand\nwind and solar energy, beef up energy storage and the electric grid, electrify\ntransportation, and make buildings energy efficient.\n\nMany of those elements are tucked into [a $3.5 trillion budget package that\nDemocrats hope to pass](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/us/politics/senate-\nbudget-plan.html) in the fall. The budget bill includes a tool called a clean\nelectricity payment program, designed to drive utilities to produce an\nincreasing amount of electricity from low and zero-carbon sources like wind,\nsolar and nuclear energy.\n\nIf approved, the measure would be the most consequential climate bill in\nUnited States history, putting the country on track to hit President Biden\u2019s\ngoal of roughly halving domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. But to get\nit through the evenly split Congress, every Democrat would need to support it\nand at least two, Senator Joe Manchin of coal-rich West Virginia and Kyrsten\nSinema of Arizona, have indicated they may oppose it.\n\nImage\n\nSenator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, left, and Senator Joe Manchin of West\nVirginia have said they may vote against the $3.5 trillion budget Democrats\nare proposing.Credit...Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times\n\nRepublican leaders, meanwhile, have made it clear they will vote against the\nbudget bill, arguing that it is too expensive and that mandates like a clean\nelectricity standard and government-funded electric vehicle expansion will\nhurt taxpayers and consumers.\n\nTheir messaging closely mirrors the position of major oil and gas companies,\nwhich are running advertising campaigns touting \u201ctechnology innovation\u201d as a\nresponse to global warming.\n\n\u201cThey are acknowledging their role in climate change, but they want the public\nto believe they are on top of it,\u201d Edward Maibach, director of George Mason\nUniversity\u2019s Center for Climate Change Communication, said of the fossil fuel\ncompanies. \u201cThey say they are innovating, they are evolving, they\u2019ve got this.\nThey don\u2019t need policy \u2014 and Republicans are following that cue.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes in Washington, oil and gas interests continue to lobby hard\nagainst policies that would reduce emissions, particularly tighter vehicle\nmileage rules that would prevent the burning of hundreds of billions of\ngallons of gasoline.\n\nThose companies are donating overwhelmingly to Republicans. In the 2020\nelection cycle alone, oil, gas, coal mining and other energy companies gave\n$46 million to the Republican Party. That\u2019s more than those industries donated\nto Democrats over the course of the last decade, according to data compiled by\nthe [Center for Responsive Politics](https://www.opensecrets.org/), a\nnonprofit group that tracks money in politics.\n\nIn many ways the $1 trillion infrastructure package, which the [Senate\napproved in a 69-30\nvote](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/us/politics/infrastructure-bill-\npasses.html) on Tuesday, shows the limits of Republican action on climate\nchange.\n\nThe package, which still needs approval from the House, includes about $80\nbillion in programs to upgrade the nation\u2019s power grid, create charging\nstations for electric vehicles and research new clean energy technologies. It\ndelivers more than $12 billion for technology to capture and store carbon\ndioxide emissions, which if commercialized at scale could prolong the life of\nfossil fuel plants; and $2.5 billion for developing a new generation of\nnuclear reactors.\n\nLeft out was any provision that would mandate the reduction of fossil fuels or\nthe emissions they produce. Nineteen Republicans, including the minority\nleader, voted for the legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n", "name": "Amid Extreme Weather, a Shift Among Republicans on Climate Change", "date_of_evidence": "20210814", "data": {"RSS Feed": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/EnergyEnvironment.xml", "Media_Cloud_ID": 1, "Company Name": "New York Times (Energy)"}, "source": "D5", "date_of_scrape": "20210816", "project": "Climate Change", "scraper": "rss_media"}, {"ref": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/climate/hydrogen-fuel-natural-gas-pollution.html", "extract": "Industry has been promoting hydrogen as a reliable, next-generation fuel to power cars, heat homes and generate electricity.

Billions of dollars from\nthe [bipartisan infrastructure\nbill](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/us/politics/infrastructure-bill-\npasses.html) have been teed up to fund it.\n\nBut [a new peer-reviewed\nstudy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ese3.956) on the\nclimate effects of hydrogen, the most abundant substance in the universe,\ncasts doubt on its role in tackling the greenhouse gas emissions that are [the\ndriver of catastrophic global\nwarming](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/climate/a-major-new-report-finds-\nsome-of-the-devastating-impacts-of-global-warming-are-now-unavoidable.html).\n\nThe main stumbling block: Most hydrogen used today is extracted from natural\ngas in a process that requires a lot of energy and emits vast amounts of\ncarbon dioxide. Producing natural gas also releases methane, a particularly\npotent greenhouse gas.\n\nAnd while the natural gas industry has proposed capturing that carbon dioxide\n\u2014 creating what it promotes as emissions-free, \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen \u2014 even that\nfuel still emits more across its entire supply chain than simply burning\nnatural gas, according to the paper, published Thursday in the Energy Science\n& Engineering journal by researchers from Cornell and Stanford Universities.\n\n\u201cTo call it a zero-emissions fuel is totally wrong,\u201d said Robert W. Howarth, a\nbiogeochemist and ecosystem scientist at Cornell and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\u201cWhat we found is that it\u2019s not even a low-emissions fuel, either.\u201d\n\nTo arrive at their conclusion, Dr. Howarth and Mark Z. Jacobson, a professor\nof civil and environmental engineering at Stanford and director of its\nAtmosphere/Energy program, examined the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of\nblue hydrogen. They accounted for both carbon dioxide emissions and the\nmethane that leaks from wells and other equipment during natural gas\nproduction.\n\nThe researchers assumed that 3.5 percent of the gas drilled from the ground\nleaks into the atmosphere, an assumption that draws on mounting research that\nhas found that drilling for natural gas emits far more methane than previously\nknown.\n\nThey also took into account the natural gas required to power the carbon\ncapture technology. In all, they found that the greenhouse gas footprint of\nblue hydrogen was more than 20 percent greater than burning natural gas or\ncoal for heat. __ (Running the analysis at a far lower gas leak rate of 1.54\npercent only reduced emissions slightly, and emissions from blue hydrogen\nstill remained higher than from simply burning natural gas.)\n\nSuch findings could alter the calculus for hydrogen. Over the past few years,\nthe natural gas industry has begun heavily promoting hydrogen as a reliable,\nnext-generation fuel to be used to power cars, heat homes and burn in power\nplants.\n\nIn the United States, Europe and elsewhere, the industry has also pointed to\nhydrogen as justification for continuing to build gas infrastructure like\npipelines, saying that pipes that carry natural gas could in the future carry\na cleaner blend of natural gas and hydrogen.\n\nImage\n\nA Royal Dutch Shell hydrogen production plant in Wesseling,\nGermany.Credit...Friedemann Vogel/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nWhile many experts agree that hydrogen could eventually play a role in energy\nstorage or powering certain types of transportation \u2014 such as aircraft or\nlong-haul trucks, where switching to battery-electric power may be challenging\n\u2014 there is an emerging consensus that a wider hydrogen economy that relies on\nnatural gas could be damaging to the climate. (At current costs, it would also\nbe very expensive.)\n\nThe latest study added to the evidence, said Drew Shindell, a professor of\nearth science at Duke University. Dr. Shindell was the lead author of [a\nUnited Nations report published this\nyear](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/climate/methane-leaks-united-\nnations.html) that found that slashing emissions of methane, the main\ncomponent of natural gas, is far more vital in tackling global warming than\npreviously thought. In a new report published this week, the U.N. warned that\nessentially all of the rise in global average temperatures since the 19th\ncentury has been driven by the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nThe hydrogen study showed that \u201cthe potential to keep using fossil fuels with\nsomething extra added on as a potential climate solution is neither fully\naccounting for emissions, nor making realistic assumptions\u201d about future\ncosts, he said in an email.\n\nThe Hydrogen Council, an industry group founded in 2017 that includes BP,\nShell, and other big oil and gas companies, did not provide immediate comment.\nA McKinsey & Company report co-authored with industry estimated that the\nhydrogen economy could generate $140 billion in annual revenue by 2030 and\nsupport 700,000 jobs. The study also projected that hydrogen could meet 14\npercent of total American energy demand by 2050. BP declined to comment.\n\nIn Washington, the latest bipartisan infrastructure package devotes $8 billion\nto creating regional hydrogen hubs, a provision originally introduced as part\nof a separate bill by Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, a\nmajor natural gas producing region. Among companies that lobbied for\ninvestment in hydrogen were NextEra Energy, which has proposed a solar-powered\nhydrogen pilot plant in Florida.\n\nSome other Democrats, like Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, have\npushed back against the idea, calling it an \u201cempty promise.\u201d Environmental\ngroups have also criticized the spending. \u201cIt\u2019s not a climate action,\u201d said\nJim Walsh, a senior energy policy analyst at Food & Water Watch, a Washington-\nbased nonprofit group. \u201cIt\u2019s this is a fossil fuel subsidy with Congress\nacting like they\u2019re doing something on climate, while propping up the next\nchapter of the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\n\nJack Brouwer, director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center at the\nUniversity of California, Irvine, said that hydrogen would ultimately need to\nbe made using renewable energy to produce what the industry calls green\nhydrogen, which uses renewable energy to split water into its constituent\nparts, hydrogen and oxygen. That, he said, would eliminate the fossil and the\nmethane leaks.\n\nHydrogen made from fossil fuels could still act as a transition fuel but would\nultimately be \u201ca small contributor to the overall sustainable hydrogen\neconomy,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst we use blue, then we make it all green,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, very little hydrogen is green, because the process involved \u2014\nelectrolyzing water to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen \u2014 is hugely energy\nintensive. In most places, there simply isn\u2019t enough renewable energy to\nproduce vast amounts of green hydrogen. (Although if the world does start to\nproduce excess renewable energy, converting it to hydrogen would be one way to\nstore it.)\n\nImage\n\nA natural gas flare in North Dakota.Credit...Eric Gay/Associated Press\n\nFor the foreseeable future, most hydrogen fuel will very likely be made from\nnatural gas through an energy-intensive and polluting method called the steam\nreforming process, which uses steam, high heat and pressure to break down the\nmethane into hydrogen and carbon dioxide.\n\nBlue hydrogen uses the same process but applies carbon capture and storage\ntechnology, which involves capturing carbon dioxide before it is released into\nthe atmosphere and then pumping it underground in an effort to lock it away.\nBut that still doesn\u2019t account for the natural gas that generates the\nhydrogen, powers the steam reforming process and runs the CO2 capture. \u201cThose\nare substantial,\u201d Dr. Howarth of Cornell said.\n\nAmy Townsend-Small, an associate professor in environmental science at the\nUniversity of Cincinnati and an expert on methane emissions, said more\nscientists were starting to examine some of the industry claims around\nhydrogen, in the same way they had scrutinized the climate effects of natural\ngas production. \u201cI think this research is going drive the conversation\nforward,\u201d she said.\n\nPlans to produce and use hydrogen are moving ahead. National Grid, together\nwith Stony Brook University and New York State, **** is studying integrating\nhydrogen into its existing gas infrastructure, though the project seeks to\nproduce hydrogen using renewable energy.\n\nEntergy believed hydrogen was \u201cpart of creating a long-term carbon-free\nfuture,\u201d complementing renewables like wind or solar, which generate power\nonly intermittently, said Jerry Nappi, a spokesman for the utility. \u201cHydrogen\nis an important technology that will allow utilities to adopt much greater\nlevels of renewables,\u201d he said.\n\nNational Grid referred to its net zero plan, which says hydrogen will play a\nmajor role in the next few decades and that producing hydrogen from renewable\nenergy was the linchpin.\n\nNew York State was \u201cexploring all technologies\u201d including hydrogen in support\nof its climate goals, said Kate T. Muller, a spokeswoman for the state\u2019s\nEnergy Research and Development Authority. Still, its researchers would\n\u201creview and consider the blue hydrogen paper,\u201d she said.\n\n## Sustainability and Climate Change: Join the Discussion\n\nImage\n\nCredit...The New York Times\n\n _Our Netting Zero series of virtual events brings together New York Times\njournalists with opinion leaders and experts to understand the challenges\nposed by global warming and to take the lead for change._\n\n  *  _Sign up for_[ _upcoming events or watch earlier discussions_](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/climate/netting-zero-sustainability-real-estate-climate-change.html) _._\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n", "name": "For Many, Hydrogen Is the Fuel of the Future.

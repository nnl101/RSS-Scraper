Jean Carroll’s yearslong court battle to hold the man who\nsexually abused her legally accountable has been extraordinary in many ways.\nFirst, because that abuser is former President Donald Trump, who used all the\npower of his office, from the [Secret\nService](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/11/will-trumps-accusers-\nfinally-get-their-day-in-court/) to the [Department of\nJustice](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/09/trump-defamation-\nlawsuit-e-jean-carroll-departmen-of-justice-what-it-means/), in various\nattempts to shrug off Carroll’s claim that he attacked her in a department\nstore dressing room in the mid-90s and then defamed her by calling her a liar.\nSecond, it’s unusual because the\n[vast](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system)\n[majority](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/252689.pdf) of survivors\nof sexual assault [never report](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv21.pdf)\nthe violence they experience, much less trudge for years through a legal\nprocess that is famously\n[hostile](https://www.motherjones.com/media/2018/02/woman-raped-charged-with-\na-false-report-pulitzer-prize/) and\n[marginalizing](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2019/11/sexual-\nassault-rape-investigation-justice/). And third, because Carroll won a civil\ncase against Trump this May—becoming the only one, out of [at least 26\nwomen](https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-\nlist-2017-12) who have publicly accused him of sexual misconduct, to succeed\nin holding him liable for it.\n\nBut there’s one way in which Carroll’s case is [not\nextraordinary](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/02/metoo-me-too-\ndefamation-libel-accuser-sexual-assault/): Her abuser is suing her for\ndefamation. On Tuesday, Trump filed a counter-claim against Carroll, arguing\nthat she smeared him when she went on TV after winning her sexual assault\nlawsuit and said that he had raped her.\n\nCarroll is not alone in facing this kind of legal retaliation. In the years\nsince the MeToo movement’s peak, individuals accused of sexual abuse and\nharassment have [increasingly](https://nwlc.org/resource/webinar-the-first-\namendment-in-the-era-of-metoo-an-introduction-to-defamation-claims-related-to-\nsexual-harassment/) filed [defamation\nlawsuits](https://www.legalmomentum.org/sites/default/files/reports/A%20Guide%20to%20Defamation%20for%20Survivors%20of%20Sexual%20Assault%20or%20Harassment.pdf)\nagainst the people who speak out against them. As I [reported back in\n2020](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/02/metoo-me-too-\ndefamation-libel-accuser-sexual-assault/), such lawsuits are seen by the\naccused as a way to clear their name, but they can also be used to punish\nsurvivors for breaking their silence.\n\nThe [televised megatrial](https://www.motherjones.com/media/2022/05/and-the-\nwinner-of-the-johnny-depp-v-amber-heard-trial-is-men/) between actors Johnny\nDepp and Amber Heard last year was a high-profile example, but such cases also\ninvolve the non-famous. In my [review](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-\njustice/2020/02/metoo-me-too-defamation-libel-accuser-sexual-assault/) of\nthese lawsuits, some of the plaintiffs included an acroyoga instructor, an\nairport maintenance chief, a massage therapist, and a bar owner. One man whom\nprosecutors\n[charged](https://www.islandpacket.com/news/local/crime/article233012102.html)\nwith sexually assaulting a woman in South Carolina filed a defamation lawsuit\nagainst her while his criminal case was still ongoing. The problem is\nespecially acute for student survivors in both high school and college, who\nare commonly threatened with a defamation lawsuits after reporting sexual\nassault to school authorities; examples of these cases predate the MeToo era.\nAs Maha Ibrahim, an attorney at [Equal Rights\nAdvocates](https://www.equalrights.org/), told me last year, “We represent the\nordinary folks, and now they’re the ones getting threatened all the time.”\n\nThe consequence, Ibrahim said, is a chilling effect on survivors—even in the\n[post-MeToo era](https://www.motherjones.com/topics/after-metoo/): “It’s going\nto be so expensive and so traumatic to defend yourself, and it’s going to\ndistract so much…that the tables are going to be completely turned. It’s not\nillogical for survivors to pause and say, ‘Is it worth it to come forward?’”\n\nIn Carroll’s case, Trump’s suit is a clear attempt to stop her from saying the\nword “rape.” It centers on the particulars of the jury’s verdict in the May\ncase, ~~~~~~~~in which jurors found him liable for sexual abuse, but not for\nrape. As my colleague Russ Choma, who attended the trial,[explained in\nMay](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/05/donald-trump-sexually-\nabused-and-defamed-e-jean-carroll-jury-finds/):\n\n> While jurors didn’t find Trump liable for raping Carroll, the verdict was\n> largely a vindication of her story. The jury had three options to choose\n> from if they believed Trump committed battery: They could have found that\n> Trump had raped her; that he had sexually abused her; or that he had\n> forcibly touched her. By choosing the second option, the jurors apparently\n> indicated they believed the bulk of Carroll’s story—that Trump pounced on\n> her, threw her against the wall of a dressing room, forcibly kissed her, and\n> shoved his hand up her dress and grabbed her genitals. Carroll said that\n> Trump had also inserted his penis, but the jury evidently did not believe\n> that Carroll’s attorneys had proved that allegation.\n\nOf course, not being held liable for sexual violence [isn’t the same as being\nexonerated](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/04/no-eric-greitens-was-\nnever-exonerated-of-sexual-\nmisconduct/#:~:text=In%20his%20Fox%20News%20interview,sexual%20assault%20scandal%20at%20all.)\nof it. And laws drawing lines between different forms of sexual assault—such\nas what counts as “sexual abuse” as opposed to “rape”—are complicated and\nanatomically specific, though they all describe serious violations. [Peer-\nreviewed\nresearch](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1524838015576391) has\nfound that such labels often don’t match the words survivors use to describe\ntheir own experiences. Carroll, for her part, has [celebrated the jury’s\nverdict](https://ejeancarroll.substack.com/p/joy-joy-joy-joy-joy-and-great-\nheavens) as a success. And when asked on CNN about what went through her mind\nwhen she learned the jury wasn’t holding Trump liable for rape, she\n[answered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPrBo2_fyAI&t=144s), “Well, I just\nimmediately say in my own head, ‘Oh yes you did, Oh yes you did.'”\n\nTrump’s countersuit will play out alongside an older lawsuit Carroll filed\nagainst him when he was still president. That case is scheduled to go to trial\nin January, and it assesses whether the former president defamed Carroll when\nresponding to her rape allegation.\n\nThe verdict against Trump in May was the result of a different case Carroll\nfiled late last year, under a brand new [New York state law\n](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/11/adult-survivors-act-donald-\ntrump-e-jean-carroll-new-york-rape-sexual-assault/)that gives some survivors a\ntemporary opportunity to sue people who sexually assaulted them. Under this\nlaw, Carroll could sue Trump directly for battery, even though the events in\nquestion happened decades ago.\n\nSo now Trump is suing Carroll for having the temerity to answer a question\nabout her own experience listening to a verdict in a sexual assault trial\n_that he lost,_ and for otherwise saying in public that he raped her. In a\n[statement](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-sues-jean-carroll-\nclaims-defamation/story?id=100437874&cid=social_twitter_abcn) to\n[reporters](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/nyregion/trump-e-jean-carroll-\nlawsuit.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes), Carroll’s lawyer, Rebecca Kaplan,\nsaid that Trump’s defamation lawsuit against Carroll “argues, contrary to both\nlogic and fact, that he was exonerated by a jury that found that he sexually\nabused E. Jean Carroll by forcibly inserting his fingers into her vagina.”\n\n“Trump’s filing is thus nothing more than his latest effort to delay\naccountability for what a jury has already found to be his defamation of E.\nJean Carroll,” Kaplan said. “But whether he likes it or not, that\naccountability is coming very soon.”\n\n",

The decision\ninvalidates the University of North Carolina and Harvard’s systems for making\nup their student body, and will, more broadly, make higher education whiter\nand society less equal.\n\nWhile the decision pushes back the country’s ability to remedy the affects of\nslavery and Jim Crow, in his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts\ncarved out what could be interpreted as a small loophole in his decision:\n“Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from\nconsidering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be\nit through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise,” Roberts wrote at the\nend of his opinion.\n\nBut Roberts himself insists that this is not a backdoor to affirmative action.\n“A benefit to a student who overcame racial discrimination, for example, must\nbe tied to that student’s courage and determination… In other words, the\nstudent must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual—not\non the basis of race.”\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the court’s ruling, it is unclear if Roberts has\nweakened his own opinion by allowing consideration of race in some instances\nor, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, has simply put “lipstick\non a pig.” Either way, the line supports the notion that Roberts was forced by\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s questions to grapple with how a truly color-\nblind admissions policy would be both unworkable and unfair.\n\nJackson raised this point during [oral\narguments](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2022/21-707_m64n.pdf)\nin October, where she gave the following hypothetical:\n\n> The first applicant says: I’m from North Carolina. My family has been in\n> this area for generations, since before the Civil War, and I would like you\n> to know that I will be the fifth generation to graduate from the University\n> of North Carolina. I now have that opportunity to do that, and given my\n> family background, it’s important to me that I get to attend this\n> university. I want to honor my family’s legacy by going to this school.\n>\n> The second applicant says, I’m from North Carolina, my family’s been in this\n> area for generations, since before the Civil War, but they were slaves and\n> never had a chance to attend this venerable institution. As an African\n> American, I now have that opportunity, and given my family — family\n> background, it’s important to me to attend this university. I want to honor\n> my family legacy by going to this school.\n\nSo, Jackson queried, under a race-blind policy, would the school be forced to\nignore the story of the Black applicant but credit the story of the white one?\nThis situation would likely cause “more of an equal protection problem than\nit’s actually solving,” she explained at the time.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion today, Jackson expanded on the hypothetical. She named\nthe two applicants John and James. John’s family has attended the UNC for\nseven generations; James would be the first in his family to enroll. Jackson’s\ndissent, in pages of detail, airs the tortured history that brought John and\nJames to this point, from slavery to Jim Crow, to truly explain the\ndisparities—not just in their individual experiences, but in those of their\nancestors.\n\n> Most likely, seven generations ago, when John’s family was building its\n> knowledge base and wealth potential on the university’s campus, James’s\n> family was enslaved and laboring in North Carolina’s fields. Six generations\n> ago, the North Carolina “Redeemers” aimed to nullify the results of the\n> Civil War through terror and violence, marauding in hopes of excluding all\n> who looked like James from equal citizenship. Five generations ago, the\n> North Carolina Red Shirts finished the job. Four (and three) generations\n> ago, Jim Crow was so entrenched in the State of North Carolina that UNC\n> “enforced its own Jim Crow regulations.” Two generations ago, North\n> Carolina’s Governor still railed against “‘integration for integration’s\n> sake’”—and UNC Black enrollment was minuscule. So, at bare minimum, one\n> generation ago, James’s family was six generations behind because of their\n> race, making John’s six generations ahead.\n\nIn a separate [dissent](https://www.motherjones.com/mojo-wire/2023/06/supreme-\ncourt-affirmative-action-dissent/), Sotomayor warns that Roberts’s concession\nis merely an exercise in trying to look good, and not one that will actually\nsoften his ruling. “This supposed recognition that universities can, in some\nsituations, consider race in application essays is nothing but an attempt to\nput lipstick on a pig,” she writes. “The Court’s opinion circumscribes\nuniversities’ ability to consider race in any form by meticulously gutting\nrespondents’ asserted diversity interests. Yet, because the Court cannot\nescape the inevitable truth that race matters in students’ lives, it announces\na false promise to save face and appear attuned to reality. No one is fooled.”\n\n",

University of Texas_. In that [2016\ndecision](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/samuel-alito-fisher-v-\ntexas-affirmative-action/), the court held that the race-conscious admissions\nprocess used by the University of Texas at Austin did not violate the equal\nprotection clause. But Kennedy retired in 2018, and President Donald Trump\nreplaced him with Justice Neil Gorsuch and two other appointees who together\nformed the voting bloc that tossed out Kennedy’s reasoning.\n\nTypically the Supreme Court only takes up a case when there is a circuit\nsplit, which there was not in the affirmative action cases. As they did with\nthe _Dobbs_ decision overturning abortion rights that the court had just\nreaffirmed in 2016, the newly activist conservative Trump majority took the\n_Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard_ and _SFFA v. University of North\nCarolina_ cases anyway, presumably with the intention of reaching the\nconclusion it issued today demolishing 40 years’ worth of court jurisprudence\nthat has allowed colleges to use race as one factor in making admissions\ndecisions.\n\nThe decisions came in two separate cases brought by SFFA, a conservative group\nled by [Edward Blum](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/edward-blum-\nsupreme-court-affirmative-action-civil-rights/), a longtime crusader against\naffirmative action and voting rights who also was the engine behind the\n_Fisher_ case. Abigail Fisher, the white plaintiff in that case who the\nUniversity of Texas rejected because of her mediocre grades, [is on the\nboard](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/abigail-fisher-going-stay-\nmad/) of Students for Fair Admissions, as is her father.\n\nOne case, against the [University of North\nCarolina](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article275218156.html),\nchallenged the use of race in admissions in public institutions based on a\nconstitutional claim that race-conscious admissions policies violated the\nequal protection rights of white and Asian applicants who were passed over in\nfavor of other minority applicants. The case against Harvard College\nchallenged the use of race under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In\nthat case, SFFA filed a lawsuit in 2014 arguing that considering race in\nadmissions resulted in discrimination against highly qualified Asian American\napplicants, who, its lawyer[s have claimed](https://slate.com/news-and-\npolitics/2022/11/harvard-jewish-quotas-asian-americans-supreme-court.html),\nwere treated much like Jews shut out of the prestigious institution in the\n1920s and ’30s. The lawsuit accused Harvard of imposing strict caps on the\nnumber of incoming Asian American students while giving preference to Black,\nHispanic, and white students who are less qualified.\n\nIn 2019, after a three-week federal bench trial, a federal district judge\nrejected that argument, and the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the trial\ncourt verdict in 2020. In ruling in Harvard’s favor, the trial court judge\ncriticized Blum’s group for failing to produce a single Asian American witness\nto testify about how they were [discriminated against by\nHarvard.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/11/the-supreme-court-\nwants-to-move-on-from-racism-already/) Indeed, in nearly a decade of\nlitigation in the case and full access to Harvard’s admissions files, SFFA has\nnever produced a single Asian American applicant to Harvard who could have or\nshould have been admitted but for the school’s allegedly discriminatory\nadmissions process. That’s no surprise given that while Asians make up about 7\npercent of the American population, they account for nearly 30 percent of\nHarvard’s class of 2027. That lack of identifiably injured parties in the\nlitigation is a major flaw that Harvard’s lawyers have argued should have\nresulted in the case being tossed out long ago because the plaintiff lacks an\ninjury that would give it standing. In its opinion today, the court said SFFA\nclearly had standing to bring the case as an organization and dismissed those\nconcerns about the lack of victims.\n\nIn a dissent she read from the bench, Justice Sonia Sotomayor denounced the\nmajority decision for contravening the equality envisioned by the 14th\nAmendment. “Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of\nprecedent and momentous progress,” she wrote. “In so holding, the Court\ncements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in\nan endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues\nto matter.”\n\nThe court’s newest justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote a separate and\nequally furious dissent. “With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the\nmajority pulls the ripcord and announces ‘colorblindness for all’ by legal\nfiat. But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life,” she\nwrote. “And having so detached itself from this country’s actual past and\npresent experiences, the Court has now been lured into interfering with the\ncrucial work that UNC and other institutions of higher learning are doing to\nsolve America’s real-world problems.”\n\nThe decision comes at a time of white backlash on the American right against\nadvances toward equality made by people of color. Presidential hopeful and GOP\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his ideological allies pushing such initiatives\nargue that the Constitution is colorblind. He is now hoping to use this agenda\nas a springboard to the White House.\n\n“The anti-DEI efforts are connected with the anti-affirmative action efforts\nin the sense that they are trying to erase any notion of systemic\ndiscrimination against historically marginalized people of color, including\nBlack people,” says Hinojosa, and our “horrid history of slavery and\ndiscrimination and the remnants thereof.”\n\nEnrollment of racial minorities at selective universities will now, as lower\ncourts warned, assuredly fall. The judge in the Harvard case\n[found](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.165519/gov.uscourts.mad.165519.672.0_14.pdf)\nthat “eliminating consideration of race would cause the African American\nrepresentation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6%… and\nHispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%,” and notably held that the\ncaliber of students would not improve. Race-neutral programs, the judge\nfurther found, would not make up for these losses. In the University North\nCarolina case, a judge\n[agreed](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ncmd.67345/gov.uscourts.ncmd.67345.254.0_2.pdf)\nthere were no “workable or viable race-neutral alternatives, singularly or in\nconjunction, that would allow [the university] to achieve the educational\nbenefits of diversity.”\n\n",

With a population of only 88,000, the\ncity has [five Superfund sites](https://www.epa.gov/il/epa-sites-city-\nwaukegan), many of them found along the Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nAnd that’s not even counting the large pools of toxic materials leftover from\ndecades of burning coal in Waukegan. Deep pits of hazardous sludge sit along\nthe shores of Lake Michigan, the watershed for roughly 12 million people.\n\nThe longer we leave (coal ash ponds) there unaddressed, something catastrophic\nis going to happen.”\n\nOrtiz, co-chair of the local environmental justice organization [Clean Power\nLake County](https://cleanpowerlakecounty.org/), calls these coal waste sites\na “ticking time bomb” vulnerable to future spills, with the potential to harm\nmillions.\n\nWaukegan’s coal-fired power plant, which closed last year, sits a little over\na mile from an elementary school, a public park, and single-family housing\nintermixed with local taquerias and bakeries. The city is majority Latino\naccording to US Census\n[data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/waukegancityillinois).\n\nNow, a permanent solution to coal industry debris could soon be a reality.\n\nWhen coal is burned for fuel, it produces a waste product known as coal ash.\nThis burnt byproduct is stored in large, manmade landfills commonly called\nponds or pits. The material is toxic and contains at least [17 heavy metals\nand radioactive materials](https://environmentalintegrity.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2022/10/Poisonous-Coverup-11.03.22.pdf), such as mercury,\ncadmium, and arsenic, which [cause cancer](https://grist.org/health/the-coal-\nplant-next-door/) and birth defects, as well as heart and lung diseases.\n\nIn May, the US Environmental Protection Agency\n[proposed](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21052023/epa-regulations-coal-\nash/) new regulations to stop a\n[loophole](https://grist.org/accountability/closing-coal-ash-loophole-epa-\nproposal/) that has allowed historic coal ash ponds to go unmonitored for\nyears.

The 2008 [Kingston, Tennesse, coal ash\nspill](https://grist.org/justice/tva-kingston-coal-ash-spill-nuclear/)—where\nover 5 million cubic yards were [spilled](https://www.epa.gov/tn/epa-response-\nkingston-tva-coal-ash-spill) into surrounding waterways and caused the [death\nof cleanup workers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/17/coal-\nspill-workers-sick-dying-tva) years after the event—is regarded as one of the\nnation’s worst industrial disasters.\n\nThe regulation of coal ash at the federal level is fairly new. In 2015, the\nEPA issued the first [national minimum\nstandards](https://grist.org/article/why-obamas-plans-to-clean-up-coal-ash-\nbarely-got-off-the-ground/) for new and operating coal ash ponds, leaving out\nhundreds of legacy sites that haven’t received coal ash since before 2015.\n\nThe recently announced EPA rule change comes on the heels of litigation from\nthe nonprofit environmental justice organization\n[Earthjustice](https://earthjustice.org/about?gclid=CjwKCAjwv8qkBhAnEiwAkY-\nahqxqcLSXvXPrI_-i6cXrtxSStQwbkN8KIGoH8Yq0sbXvp36orOO7rhoC6QgQAvD_BwE). Lisa\nEvans, senior counsel there, told _Grist_ that the newly proposed ruling goes\na long way to prevent future disasters, calling current regulations on legacy\ncoal ash ponds “irrational, dangerous, and reckless.”\n\n“The EPA made a lot of compromises in the 2015 rule and came out with the\nweakest rule it could have created,” said Evans.\n\nCoal ash ponds are [notorious for\nleaking](https://e360.yale.edu/features/coal-ash-united-states-epa-rule) into\nsurrounding bodies of water and soil. According to a\n[report](https://grist.org/regulation/report-90-percent-coal-plants-\ncontaminate-groundwater-pollution/) last year, roughly 90 percent of coal\nplants have tainted the surrounding groundwater.\n\nSome 70 percent of defunct power plants with coal ash ponds are in low-income\nor majority-nonwhite census tracts.\n\nThat same report also found that approximately 70 percent of decommissioned\npower plants with accompanying coal ash ponds are found in low-income\ncommunities or majority-nonwhite census tracts.\n\nOrtiz said that in addition to fear of toxic materials slowly seeping into\nLake Michigan, she worries climate change is speeding up the chance for future\ndisasters.\n\nIn a [report](https://elpc.org/resources/rising-waters-climate-change-impacts-\nand-toxic-risks-to-lake-michigans-shoreline-communities/) published last year,\nthe Midwest environmental advocacy nonprofit [Environmental Law and Policy\nCenter](https://elpc.org/) found that Lake Michigan has 12 toxic waste sites\nthat are particularly at risk of spilling and harming nearby communities,\nthanks to lake erosion and increased storms fueled by climate change.\n\nWaukegan was identified as one of the sites, alongside other coal ash ponds in\nIndiana and Wisconsin. The Waukegan Generating Station no longer operates its\ncoal-fired power stations, but its waste remains. Midwest Generation, a\nsubsidiary of national energy company NRG Energy, owns the power plant.\n\nTwo coal ash ponds at the plant are in the process of being cleaned up.\nAccording to Midwest Generation, one pond will be capped and covered, a\nprocess where the pond is filled with soil and sediment and covered with\nplastic, and remains in place. The other pond will have its materials\nexcavated and moved to a permitted disposal landfill.\n\nBoth ponds are currently regulated by the EPA and the cleanup process is on\nhold as the company awaits state permitting approval. A third site at the\nWaukegan plant is a historic coal ash waste site that has not received coal\nash since 1977, according to Midwest Generation. This would classify the site\nas a legacy coal ash site and its cleanup would likely be regulated under the\nnew EPA proposal.\n\nIn a statement, Midwest Generation said it is still reviewing the EPA’s\nproposal and “will continue to be committed to compliance with applicable laws\nand will comply with any final rules related to legacy (coal) ash areas.”\n\nThe decommissioning of coal-fired power is part of an overarching Illinois\ninitiative to be coal-free by 2045. Illinois was the [first state in the\nMidwest](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/midwest-first-illinois-bans-\nfossil-fuel-electricity-sources-2021-09-15/) to legislate the phaseout of\ncoal-fired power plants and focus on renewable energy and environmental\njustice with the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.\n\nAlongside proper environmental cleanup and regulation, Ortiz said the issue of\nenvironmental justice is key to the future of Waukegan.\n\nThe still-standing coal plant in Waukegan is a “symbol of pain and suffering”\nfor Ortiz. She said it’s a reminder that Waukegan residents, specifically\nBlack and Latino, have been sacrificed in the name of industry profit.\n\nThere are 88 coal ash dumps within two miles of the Great Lakes, the water\nsource for an estimated 30 million people.\n\nShe said when visiting other, affluent and majority-white suburbs in the\nregion, the communities along Lake Michigan have full use of the natural\nresource and aren’t exposed to the dangers of legacy coal pollution. “Why\ncan’t we have that as well? Why can’t our children have an easily accessible\nlakefront?” she said.\n\nCoal may not be synonymous with the Midwest, but the region has an abundance\nof coal ash ponds. According to data from Earthjustice, Indiana, Illinois, and\nOhio are among the top five states with regulated and unregulated coal ash\nponds. Additionally, there are 88 coal ash dump sites within two miles of at\nleast one of the Great Lakes, the water source for an estimated 30 million\npeople.\n\nFollowing the curve of Lake Michigan, a city in northwest Indiana echoes\nWaukegan’s past, and the residents hope new regulations could chart a future\nwithout polluting industries in their backyard.\n\nMichigan City, Indiana, is located roughly 100 miles from Waukegan and is home\nto 32,000 residents, a third of them Black.\n\nIndiana has the [largest\nnumber](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1252352/us-coal-power-plants-by-\nstate/#:~:text=Indiana%20is%20home%20to%20the,which%20ranked%20second%20that%20year.)\nof operational coal plants in the country and 100 coal ash sites. According to\nEarthjustice [estimates](https://earthjustice.org/feature/coal-ash-\nstates/indiana), half of these sites are currently unregulated.\n\nAshley Williams is the executive director of [Just Transition Northwest\nIndiana](https://www.jtnwi.org/), a nonprofit environmental justice\norganization based out of Michigan City.\n\nShe said the contamination is a “silent crisis” with roughly 2 million tons of\ntoxic coal ash sitting near Lake Michigan. Michigan City’s coal-fired power\nplant sits in the shadow of nearby playgrounds, homes, and public beaches.\n\n![](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cooling-tower-\ncopy.jpg?w=642)![](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2023/06/cooling-tower-copy.jpg?w=642)\n\nA cooling tower for a coal-power plant overlooks this playground in Michigan\nCity, Indiana.\n\nJust Transition Northwest Indiana\n\nThe Michigan City Generating Station, owned by the Northern Indiana Public\nService Company, or NIPSCO, is still in operation. The coal plant has five ash\nponds that are regulated under current federal rulings.\n\nLike Waukegan, the NIPSCO site includes one currently unregulated man-made\ncoal ash fill, which contains sediment, sand, and coal ash, and is used to\nbuffer the coal plant from Lake Michigan’s waters.\n\nThe infrastructure that stops this material from spilling into Lake Michigan\nis aging and at risk of a “catastrophic release,” according to an [engineering\nstudy](https://energynews.us/2022/08/25/historic-coal-ash-a-buried-brewing-\nthreat-to-lake-michigan-and-beyond/) authorized by Earthjustice.\n\nAccording to [Energy News Network](https://energynews.us/2022/08/25/historic-\ncoal-ash-a-buried-brewing-threat-to-lake-michigan-and-beyond/), the seawall\nsite contains roughly two million cubic yards of coal ash and areas of the\npond go as deep as 40 feet in the ground. A NIPSCO spokesperson disputed the\nestimated amount of coal ash on the historic site, which the news site said is\nbased on NIPSCO documents. In a statement to Grist, NIPSCO said there is an\nestimated 109,000 tons of leftover coal material outside of the ponds. This\nseawall location would likely be regulated under the new EPA proposal.\n\nIn a statement, NIPSCO said it will “continue to monitor the progression of\nEPA’s latest proposal for regulations related to coal ash management and how\nthis might apply to the work we’re already doing to comply with current\nregulations.”\n\nWilliams said the region’s history of industrial pollution is buried\neverywhere. The nearby town of Pines, Michigan has been in a [longstanding\ncleanup and legal\nbattle](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2022/03/10/nipsco-\npaying-millions-clean-coal-ash-contaminated-indiana-town-pines/9410858002/)\ndating back to the 1970s. For decades, NIPSCO dumped coal ash waste in the\ntown’s landfill, used it to build roads, and gave it to residents to fill\ntheir yards and homes.\n\nThe NIPSCO coal-fired power plant will close [as early as\n2026](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2022/05/26/nipscos-planned-move-\ncoal-solar-delayed-2-plants/9799621002/). Williams said she wants to ensure\nthe site doesn’t get developed and turned into another site of environmental\ninjustice.\n\nShe said Just Transition Northwest Indiana advocates for a statewide shift in\nenergy production and wants both youth and current industry workers to be at\nthe forefront of planning the future of the region.\n\n“We’re trying to reclaim our power from polluters,” she said. “What’s\nhappening in Michigan City is the beginning of what a just national transition\ncould be.”\n\n",

In some\ncases, [lack of documentation in land\nclaims](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-landrights-conference-tech/land-\nlaws-worthless-without-proof-of-ownership-experts-idUSKCN1NK2GZ) can leave\ncommunities vulnerable to inconsistent and violent expulsion policies by local\nofficials, making it difficult to reach resolutions, due process, or receive\njust compensation for oppressive tactics carried out by governments,\ncompanies, or individuals.\n\n[Multiple studies](https://www.fao.org/americas/publicaciones-audio-\nvideo/forest-gov-by-indigenous/en/) have shown that Indigenous peoples are\nsome of the best managers and [protectors of the\nenvironment](https://unfccc.int/news/how-indigenous-peoples-enrich-climate-\naction) and that rights-based approaches could be critical to [curbing the\neffects of climate change](https://grist.org/global-indigenous-affairs-\ndesk/the-best-way-to-save-forests-legally-recognize-indigenous-lands/).\n\n“There’s a need for donors to invest in funding advocacy for legal commissions\nand directly supporting communities so they can secure their rights,” said\nSolange Bandiaky-Badji, coordinator of Rights and Resources Initiative. “But\ngovernments need to put in implementation and regulation mechanisms so we can\nincrease the number of areas under the ownership of local communities and\nIndigenous peoples.”\n\n“There’s still a lot that needs to be done, it’s insufficient really.”\n\nAccording to the report, sub-Saharan Africa saw the biggest increase in legal\nrecognition of community land rights, gaining nearly 87 million acres, and\nlargely driven by efforts in Kenya and Liberia to recognize communities’\ncustomary lands.\n\nIn 2016, Kenya’s government implemented the [Community Land\nAct](http://kenyalaw.org:8181/exist/rest/db/kenyalex/Kenya/Legislation/English/Acts%20and%20Regulations/C/Community%20Land%20Act%20-%20No.%2027%20of%202016/docs/CommunityLandAct27of2016.pdf),\nwhich led to engaging with the government and rights holders to figure out the\nbest way to implement the “progressive provisions of the recognition of the\nrights on the ground,” said Bandiaky-Badji.\n\nLiberia passed the Land Rights Act in 2018, which recognized traditional lands\nand launched a land process to partner with local community organizations and\nnetworks to recognize customary land rights.\n\nAccording to researchers, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC, is a\ncountry to watch, after passing a historic [law recognizing the\nrights](https://news.mongabay.com/2022/11/after-14-years-of-advocacy-the-drc-\npresident-signs-new-indigenous-peoples-law-commentary/) of Indigenous peoples\nin 2022.\n\n”The DRC has been going through major reform processes,” said Bandiaky-Badji.\n“The Indigenous Pygmy law that was adopted less than two years ago was a real\nmilestone, because it allows Indigenous people to claim their collective\nrights. It’s helping grow and implement the demarcating of the land of\nIndigenous peoples.”\n\nIn 2020, the Republic of Congo (a nation separate from the DRC), passed a\nhistoric law that introduces new concepts like certification, verification of\nlegality, consideration of riverside communities, deforestation and\nreforestation, carbon credits, and the fight against climate change. In\ntandem, the study contends that both countries have an opportunity to\naccelerate land-rights recognition in the Congo Basin in the years to come.\n\nAsia is home to an estimated [70 percent\n](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples) of the world’s\nIndigenous population, and nearly 22 percent of land is owned by communities.\nOf the countries analyzed in South and Southeast Asia, over 44 million acres\nare designated for, or owned by, Indigenous peoples and local communities.\n\nThe report found that compared to the data collected in 2015, community land\nrecognition increased 18 times in India and nearly seven times in Indonesia\nover five years. However, scientists noted only Cambodia, India, Indonesia,\nand the Philippines have national, legal frameworks recognizing community-\nbased ownership. In [China](https://www.iwgia.org/en/china.html), collective\nownership of forestland and an extensive pasture contract system cover nearly\nhalf the country’s land area. If China were not included in the study, Asia\nwould have the lowest percentage of community ownership of any region, at only\n0.8 percent.\n\n“There’s still a lot that needs to be done, it’s insufficient really. It’s\nreally important to look into countries where there are still gaps of\nrecognizing the rights of communities,” said Bandiaky-Badj. “We want to\nrecognize the rights of Indigenous people, local communities, and the rights\nof women. We need to push for more recognition of land rights.”\n\n",

From afar, that might seem odd. Breitbart? Calling\nsomeone else (and specifically another figure on the right) racist? The\npublication that had a vertical on “Black Crime”?\n\nTo understand why requires keeping an eye on the rifts and fissures in a group\nof hyper online, pseudo-intellectuals as they beef over who to choose in the\nRepublican primary—and in the process engage in a potentially internecine, and\nat times baffling, war. Or, put another way: Gonzalez has publicly supported\nDeSantis; Breitbart has seemed to back Trump.\n\n“The only reason my private messages—messages I exchanged with *Trump\nsupporters* from a different, dumb season of my life—are being used against me\nis that I’ve become the most effective critic of Trump since jumping off the\nTrump train,” Gonzalez said in [a\nstatement](https://twitter.com/emeriticus/status/1673870848766226432?s=20),\ncalling the article a “smear” meant to silence him.\n\nOnce allies who endorsed each other’s campaigns, Trump and DeSantis have been\nin [a slow-simmering feud](https://www.tampabay.com/news/2023/04/01/desantis-\ntrump-indictment-primary-crime-2024-coronavirus/) since at-least last summer\nwhen DeSantis’ [autocratic\naspirations](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/05/ron-desantis-\nautocracy/) as governor of Florida made him a\n[national](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/13/magazine/ron-desantis.html)\n[political figure](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/06/27/can-ron-\ndesantis-displace-donald-trump-as-the-gops-combatant-in-chief). Gonzalez has\nbeen one of DeSantis’ most loyal soldiers,\n[writing](https://contra.substack.com/p/only-the-best-\ncriminals?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2) and\n[tweeting](https://twitter.com/emeriticus/status/1673165442397995008?s=20)\n[incessantly](https://twitter.com/emeriticus/status/1671189237020995584?s=20)\nabout why the Florida Governor is superior to Trump.\n\nAs the primary continues, the debate seems clear. On one side, there are the\nMAGA loyalists who remain committed to their living Lost Cause. On the other\nside, there is a growing group of self-styled intellectuals who are now\nbetting that DeSantis can deliver a version of Trumpism without the baggage of\nTrump.\n\nThe latter group can feel loud. (That is perhaps because, as _The Daily Beast_\n[reported](https://www.thedailybeast.com/ron-desantis-secret-twitter-army-of-\nfar-right-influencers), the DeSantis campaign recruited a “secret Twitter army\nof far-right influencers.”) And their logic is straightforward. The DeSantis\nright thinks voters were more swayed by Trump’s accidental reinvention of Pat\nBuchanan—white identity politics with a dash of industrial policy and foreign\nisolationism—than Trump’s [accidental\nmagnetism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/magazine/trump-liberal-comedy-\ntv.html). The question of DeSantis versus Trump is: Did voters like the rich,\nfamous, and often hilarious television star who transformed politics into\nentertainment—whose rallies were like rock concerts, and who gave Americans\npermission to be the worst, most belligerent version of themselves—or did they\nlike the policies he promised?\n\nOn paper, and from the vantage of a liberal harangued by emails warning of\ndoom and asking for money, perhaps it appears little difference between these\ntwo men: DeSantis is just Trump with a brain. He says “[cultural\nMarxism](https://youtu.be/Fn3A4Bu0f9A)” and he might have paged through some\nSam Francis or Oswald Spengler, but what is so different?\n\nThat ignores a key part of Trump: He often gestured at doing something\nterrible but failed to complete the task. This emboldened a series of right\nwing movements—from Charlottesville’s Nazis to [the Claremont\nReview](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/magazine/claremont-institute-\nconservative.html). But it did not satiate their desire. (And, one could\nargue, it meant he did not enact as many harmful policies that would’ve\ndissuaded voters.)\n\nDeSantis, on the other hand, has acted boldly. He’s wielded the governor’s\noffice as a bludgeon to bash [queer\npeople](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/03/desantis-dont-say-\ngay-k-12-students-florida/), [Black\npeople](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/02/ap-african-american-\nhistory-ron-desantis/),\n[teachers](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/03/ron-desantis-florida-\nteachers/), [public sector unions](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/news/florida-\ngov-ron-desantis-signs-anti-union-bill-into-law-calling-it-paycheck-\nprotection-34156024),\n[Disney](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/28/florida-gov-\nron-desantis-legal-feud-with-disney-world-explained/70361872007/), [the\nformerly incarcerated](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/11/04/florida-\ns-voter-fraud-arrests-are-scaring-away-formerly-incarcerated-voters), and\n[immigrants](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/02/us/migrants-marthas-vineyard-\ndesantis-texas.html). He has no time for retail politics; for glad-handing\nretired boat dealers at Mar-a-Lago like Trump. This has attracted young,\nbookish right-wingers like Gonzalez.\n\nBut the problem for DeSantis is that in 2023 right-wing dorks are increasingly\nlikely to cross-pollinate with the far right of the party, as Alex Pareene\npresciently [predicted in 2017. ](https://splinternews.com/charlottesville-\nwas-a-preview-of-the-future-of-the-repu-1797988745)Gonzalez’s boss at\n_Chronicles_ is Paul Gottfried, one of Richard Spencer’s chief intellectual\ninfluences, who\n[_Tablet_](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/spencer-gottfried-\nalt-right) called a “philosophical lodestone for white nationalists.” In one\nof the texts leaked by Breitbart, Gonzalez praised two of the biggest heroes\nfor young, online racists: [Nick\nFuentes](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/01/nick-fuentes/) and\n[Bronze Age Pervert](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/06/after-metoo-\nandrew-tate-jordan-peterson-influencers-men-fight-back/). “Like it or not,\nsomewhere between BAP and Fuentes is the future,” Gonzalez wrote. “It will be\nopen to race realism, it will be anti-Zionism, it will be hostile to LGBTQ,\nand it will prefer strength over weakness. All of those things were present in\nAmerica 1950.”\n\nThe cleavage revealed by the Breitbart report will be important to watch as\nthe Republican primary unfolds. Trump and his movement’s embrace of openly\nracist and fascistic rhetoric was bad. (Let’s not forget Trump’s private\ndinner with Fuentes and Kanye West.) But the migration of some sections of the\nright towards DeSantis is not because they find that disqualifying. It’s\nbecause they seem to believe DeSantis is competent enough to follow through.\n\n",

I reached\nout to [Aja Barber](https://www.ajabarber.com/), author of the book _Consumed:\nThe Need for Collective Change: Colonialism, Climate Change, and Consumerism,_\nto learn more about the culture of overconsumption that social media has\ncreated and the role influencers play in fast fashion’s success.\n\n**What was your reaction to the Shein influencer trip?**\n\nI wasn’t surprised. But it is interesting that judging by the widespread\ndisapproval, the rest of the internet is starting to pick up on it.\n\n**How would you describe Shein’s place in the fast fashion world, in\ncomparison to similar brands?**\n\nWhile a lot of the mainstream big box stores that we see are fast fashion,\nShein has perfected the formula. They’re so much bigger, and so much faster.\nTechnically speaking, they’re so much more savvy than a lot of the big box\nstores and that’s why they’re tenfold beating them all with their own game. If\nI didn’t hate this business and this model, I would be like “Congratulations,”\nbut in actuality, they’ve just succeeded at being the absolute worse.\n\n**Is it even possible for fast fashion to be sustainable?**\n\nThe entire model of fast fashion isn’t sustainable. You can’t have sustainable\nor ethical fast fashion. It needs to slow down to be those two things.\n\nEthical fashion is not going to make you super-duper rich. But it’ll mean you\ncan sleep at night, which I like.\n\n**Since fast fashion’s business model allows brands to set their products at\nan absurdly low price, many argue that its existence is justified because\nallows low-income people to buy trendy clothes.** **What often isn’t brought\nup are the often exploited garment workers in these factories. Your thoughts\non this erasure?**\n\nThe erasure of exploited people from the conversation of sustainable fashion\nhas allowed people to feel okay about this system. Without actually discussing\nthe people that make the clothing who happen to be the most impoverished in\nthis conversation. This really is a dishonest conversation where we’re just\njustifying our consumerism. If we’re going to talk honestly about classism,\nlet’s talk honestly. But without mentioning the people that make the clothing,\nwho are trapped in wage slavery, you’re not being honest.\n\n**Can you describe the role that influencers play in making Shein a household\nname?**\n\nI definitely saw more of this on Tik Tok than on Instagram. But in general,\nwithout influencers, this whole fast fashion model looks entirely different.\nIf you are someone who’s really good at affiliate linking and you’re selling a\nlot of clothing, then arguably, you are a huge part of the fast fashion\nproblem.\n\nI don’t think that we should be banding together to internet-bully\nindividuals. But pretending like influencers aren’t a part of this wheel of\nconsumption is completely shortsighted.\n\n**Can you describe the role that the social media platforms themselves play in\nthis?**\n\nI would argue that social media was a godsend for profit margins for fast\nfashion companies because it’s the cheapest marketing you can get. Some people\nwill happily take gifted items from a brand. They don’t have to pay for it,\nand then they share it. A single influencer can definitely sell thousands of\ngarments very quickly, much quicker than traditional media. Brands have\nbasically found a new way to exploit people. I think a lot of people with\nplatforms don’t realize that, in many ways, they’re being exploited as well.\n\n**Several people on social media, yourself included, have pointed out the\nmarginalized identities of the influencers who attended the brand trip. Is it\na coincidence that influencers who are plus-sized and racial minorities\nhistorically make less than their thin, white counterparts?**\n\nI look at this landscape, and I’ve been watching it for years. The people that\nmade the most amount of money when fast fashion was really getting going were\nthin and white. Some of them were already independently wealthy, so they\ndidn’t even need to do it. Now they’re all moving on.\n\nFast fashion is quickly becoming this smelly thing that you don’t really want\nfollowing you around. But these companies also realize marginalized\ncommunities’ desperation to be included and that telling minority creators\nthey have a seat at the table is pretty powerful. And so while the people that\nmade the five and six figures deals years ago are happily skipping into the\nsunset because now they care about sustainability.\n\nNow, after they made the most amount of money in the conversation, you’re\ngoing to be left there holding the bag. And these fast fashion companies are\neven getting you at a discount because they’re not paying you as much as that\nperson got paid. I really want marginalized people to understand a brand that\nexploits marginalized people is exploiting you as well. You just don’t\nrealize.\n\n**Are there ways for influencers to be more responsible about the brands they\nchoose to work with?**\n\nIt’s really hard because if you want to make a living from selling clothing\nwith this model, you’re going to have to work with fast fashion. The reality\nis that we shouldn’t be aspiring to make a living that way. The vast majority\nof the brands that can afford to do the massive campaigns are going to be fast\nfashion brands. Additionally, 90 percent of the money in the fashion industry\nis going to just a handful of brands, which means that ethical and sustainable\nbrands generally do not have the marketing dollars to pay influencers what\nthey’re expecting from brands.\n\nSo until we even the playing field, people probably shouldn’t expect ethical\nbrands to have massive six-figure campaigns going because that just isn’t how\nethical fashion works until the world change.\n\n**I’m sure for many that’s got to be a hard pill to swallow.**\n\nI think a lot of influencers sign up for it and don’t realize that brands have\ninfluencers right where they want them. There are a lot of people that are\njust willing to do things for free because they think that it will lead to\nbigger things. So even ten years ago, influencers getting five-figure deals\nwas a pretty common thing. That’s changed because the influencer market has\nbecome super flooded.\n\nI don’t have any good advice about selling clothing except don’t aim to be a\nmillionaire because you’re probably not going to get that in an ethical way.\nAnd that’s okay. Because you don’t need to be a millionaire to have a nice\nlife. Ethical fashion is not going to make you super-duper rich. But it’ll\nmean you can sleep at night, which I like. I think there’s a lifestyle that\npeople want to achieve with influencing and I’ve never aspired to that\nlifestyle.\n\n_This interview has been edited for length and clarity._\n\n* * *\n\n_If you buy a book using a[Bookshop\nlink](https://bookshop.org/p/books/consumed-the-need-for-collective-change-\ncolonialism-climate-change-and-consumerism-aja-\nbarber/17761916?ean=9781538709849) on this page, a small share of the proceeds\nsupports our journalism._\n\n",

One of her recent nuggets of outrage-bait? Taking aim at\nBarack Obama, a president who hasn’t been on a ballot in over a decade.\n\nLast week, in an op-ed in the British tabloid, the _Daily Mail_ , Haley\n[presented](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12218799/NIKKI-HALEY-\nObama-cynically-attacked-dared-say-America-NOT-racist.html) Obama as both a\nsymbol of division and as evidence that America is not a racist country. That\nwas news to me! For Haley, the proof (or lack thereof) hinges on his election,\nconveniently ignoring the stark disparities faced everyday by Black people and\nother people of color around the country.\n\nHaley argues that issues affecting the Black community are a result of\nDemocratic party policies run amok. “They would rather tear down our country\nthan admit their own errors and try a different way,” she writes. “If\nDemocrats get their way, black and brown kids will think they’re inferior and\nhave no place in our country.” But it didn’t take me long to discover while\nmaking this video that many of the cities with the best outcomes for Black\npeople are run by Democrats in heavily Democratic areas, such as Charlotte,\nMiramar, Durham, and Pembroke Pines.\n\n> Nikki Haley's poll numbers are nothing to be jealous of. Maybe it's why she\n> keeps trying to stir up some outrage.\n>\n> But\n> [@garrison_hayes](https://twitter.com/garrison_hayes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> sees right through it. [pic.twitter.com/QyXNwDX4Zp](https://t.co/QyXNwDX4Zp)\n>\n> — Mother Jones (@MotherJones) [June 28,\n> 2023](https://twitter.com/MotherJones/status/1674133975512809472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAnd this isn’t the only time in recent weeks that Nikki Haley, who is now [one\nof a dozen Republican presidential\nhopefuls](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/us/politics/presidential-\ncandidates-2024.html), has played the blame game and sparked outrage. A few\nweeks ago, at a televised CNN town hall event, Haley\n[blamed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/06/haley-falsely-\nlinks-rise-girls-suicidal-thoughts-trans-athletes/) trans people for growing\nteen suicide rates, a [baseless claim](https://www.motherjones.com/mojo-\nwire/2023/06/nikki-haley-trans-kids-teen-suicides/) that was swiftly condemned\nby a broad swathe of advocates, educators, and doctors.\n\nIn the end, I’m left wondering who Nikki Haley will blame for her dismal\npolling numbers. A recent [Morning Consult\nsurvey](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-\nprimary-r/2024/national/) of GOP voters shows Haley languishing at a mere\nthree percent.\n\nPerhaps if Haley spent less time stirring up outrage, she might have time to\nlearn about some simple facts about race in America.\n\n",

        "text": "A bipartisan group of House members want to use the next farm bill to stop the\ngovernment from being able to use the Food for Peace program to provide\ninternational food assistance in the form of cash or commodities grown outside\nthe U.S.\n\nA recently introduced measure, the [American Farmers Feed the World\nAct](http://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/2023/06/27/American-Farmers-Feed-\nthe-World-Act-of-2023-draft.pdf), that the lawmakers want in the farm bill\nwould restrict Food for Peace - also known as P.L. 480 Title II - to U.S-grown\ncommodities.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, the U.S. Agency for International Development paid about $2.6\nbillion to ship 1.8 million metric tons of wheat, rice, soy products and other\nU.S.-grown commodities to feed 53 million people in 21 countries, according to\nUSAID data.\n\nSome lawmakers and farm groups say the legislation is needed to ensure\nAmerican crops aren’t replaced by cash assistance and foreign commodities in\nFood for Peace, but humanitarian groups say the bill could be catastrophic for\nthose in need.\n\n“Congress always intended for these foreign relief programs to be a triple\nbottom line: A win for America’s farmers in years when they grow more than\nthey can sell,” said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who introduced the House\nversion of the bill last week with Reps. Tracey Mann, R-Kan., Rick Crawford,\nR-Ark., and Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif.\n\nGaramendi called the legislation “a win for projecting the generous spirit of\nAmericans to help those starving around the world. Our bipartisan bill\nrestores this careful balance to ensure that taxpayer dollars for foreign\nrelief are spent on American-grown foods transported on U.S.-flag vessels, not\nforeign alternatives.”\n\n![John Garamendi](/ext/resources/Capitol-Hill/House/John-\nGaramendi/thumb/John_Garamendi.jpg)**_Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif._**\n\nFarm groups like the National Association of Wheat Growers, USA Rice\nFederation, American Soybean Association and the American Farm Bureau\nFederation were quick to throw their support behind the bill that would\nguarantee that at least half of the Food for Peace budget goes toward\nprocuring American-grown commodities and the related costs for ocean freight.\n\n“Our nation's farmers have a long and storied history supporting these vital\nhumanitarian efforts around the world, and this legislation helps keep the\nAmerican farmer at the center of America's international food aid policies,\"\nAmy France, vice chair of the National Sorghum Producers, said in a statement.\n\nBut while farm groups are rallying behind the **** bill, humanitarian groups\nthat do much of the work in foreign countries to distribute U.S.-sponsored\nfood aid assert the legislation would deprive desperately needed assistance\nfrom millions of people.\n\n“The legislation subverts the mandate of Food for Peace Title II and would\nmake it nearly impossible to implement resilience-building programs that help\ncommunities feed themselves and bounce back from stresses like droughts or\nprice shocks,” Catholic Relief Services, Mercy Corps, Oxfam America, Action\nAgainst Hunger, Bread for the World and other groups noted in a joint\nstatement.\n\nShiploads of U.S. wheat, rice and more are needed for international emergency\naid, but sometimes it's necessary to work with local farmers to develop their\nown crop value chains and build resilience, said Barrett Alexander, director\nof policy and advocacy for Mercy Corps.\n\nThe House bill – designed to be “marker” legislation for inclusion in the next\nfarm bill – would remove all funding in P.L. 480 Title II for cash assistance\nor local and regional purchases.\n\n“American food aid should be produced in America,” said Crawford, a senior\nmember of the House Agriculture Committee. “It is disingenuous to continue to\nuse funds to purchase foreign commodities and call it ‘American aid.’ No one\nknows the business of feeding the world better than American farmers.”\n\nBut anti-hunger organizations stress that the vast majority of Food for Peace\nfunding already goes toward buying U.S. commodities and shipping them\noverseas.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[Farm groups spotlight climate, largely hold off on farm bill talk at\nCommodity Classic](/articles/17363-farm-groups-spotlight-climate-largely-hold-\noff-on-farm-bill-talk-at-commodity-classic)[USDA rushes trade aid; farm groups\nmake pitches](/articles/12223-usda-rushes-trade-aid-farm-groups-make-\npitches)[Pandemic drives urgency for international food\naid](/articles/13571-pandemic-drives-urgency-for-international-food-aid)\n\nIn FY22, 36% of Title II funding was used to buy and bag commodities like\nwheat, vegetable oil, lentils, pulses and cornmeal, while another 10% paid for\nocean freight and 23% for transportation in foreign countries as well as\nstorage and handling. Just 0.39% went toward cash assistance or buying\ncommodities in or near the countries where aid was needed, according to USAID.\n\nUSAID has a separate account, the [Emergency Food Security\nProgram](https://www.usaid.gov/food-assistance/emergency-activities), that\nenables humanitarian organizations to purchase food near or in an affected\ncountry or to provide cash or vouchers to needy people to purchase their own\nfood.\n\nAlthough cash assistance and local and regional purchasing accounts for a tiny\npercentage of Food for Peace spending, that kind of aid can have a large\nimpact on those in need, according to humanitarian organization sources.\n\n“The loss of these programs would leave 3 million people without assistance,\npushing them closer to extreme hunger,” the groups said in a statement.\n\n **Don’t miss a beat!

The group says it “uses vouchers for seeds\nand cash transfers to allow program participants to purchase chickens and\ngoats.”\n\n![Mann-Crawford-Ag-Groups.jpg](/ext/resources/Newsletter-\nphotos/2023/6-28-23/Mann-Crawford-Ag-Groups.jpg)Ag organizations in support of\nthe American Farmers Feed the World Act stand with Reps.

Tracey Mann)\n\nThat tactic, the organization says, “is a sustainable approach that provides\nfood and livestock in the immediate term while also acting as a multiplier to\ngenerate income and increase resilience to shocks and stressors. If CARE were\nrequired to use U.S.-grown foods in place of these activities, it would risk\ndisrupting local production, drastically increasing the amount of funding\nspent on shipping food, and ultimately, have little impact on long-term food\nsecurity.”\n\nAll of the funding for those types of assistance are contained in what’s\ncalled the “202 (e) enhanced” section of Title II. There’s also an equally\nwonky titled “202 (e) regular” section that essentially funds the non-\ngovernmental organization activities, and the legislation would also slash\nthose funds, hobbling the ability of NGOs to pay the salaries of staff that\nget the aid from ships to people, monitor the distribution of commodities, and\nwork with local agricultural extension agents, said Alexander.\n\nThe 2018 farm bill allowed those administrative funds to range from 7.5% to\n20% of the yearly Title II budget, but the American Farmers Feed the World Act\nwould slash that to a range of 5% to 10%.\n\nAnd that means lawmakers would be risking the ability of NGOs to get U.S.\ncommodities from foreign ports to the people that need it, says Eric Muñoz,\nsenior program manager for Oxfam America.\n\nFunding for “202 (e) regular” in fiscal year 2022 made up 15% of Title II\nspending, according to USAID, which says it requires its NGO partners to\n“oversee every phase of food distribution, including supply chain monitoring,\nduring distributions, and post-distribution to ensure food is safe and the\nintended people receive our assistance.”\n\n“The unfortunate reality is that getting food to the location is only part of\nthe equation of getting food to the people who need it most,” said Muñoz. “The\nother part of the equation is making sure that you identify the right\nindividuals.”\n\nFor more news, go to [www.Agri-Pulse.com](//www.Agri-Pulse.com).\n\n",

        "text": "Renewable diesel isn’t just the hottest biofuel on the market, it also is\nswiping a significant slice of corn ethanol’s share of the Renewable Fuel\nStandard, according to EPA.\n\n[EPA’s new biofuel usage targets, or Renewable Volume Obligations, for 2023\nthrough 2025 ](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/19595-epa-finalizes-\nmultiyear-biofuel-targets-trims-2024-2025-volumes)project strong growth for\nbiomass-based diesel, which includes conventional biodiesel as well as\nrenewable diesel, and stagnating sales of corn ethanol.\n\nThe overall RVO for this year is 20.9 billion ethanol-equivalent gallons. That\ngrows to 21.5 billion in 2024 and 22.3 billion in 2025, with virtually all of\nthat increase coming in the form of renewable diesel.\n\nThe targets include carveouts in each year's RVO of 15 billion gallons for\nconventional renewable fuel, a category that has traditionally been devoted to\ncorn ethanol. EPA expects refiners to use less than 13.9 billion gallons of\ncorn ethanol a year to fill that requirement, with the rest coming from\nbiomass-based diesel, renewable diesel or its older cousin, biodiesel.\n\n“What EPA is doing is they're essentially forcing biomass-based diesel to\ncompete into the conventional category,” said Scott Gerlt, an economist with\nthe American Soybean Association. “They’re getting their numbers by\nessentially assuming that ethanol production goes down, so that we need to\nfill that with renewable diesel and biodiesel.”\n\nEPA is forecasting 13.85 billion gallons of corn ethanol will be used this\nyear, 13.96 billion gallons in 2024 and 13.78 billion gallons in 2025.\n\n![Scott Gerlt](/ext/resources/Newsletter-\nphotos/2021/9-15-21/Scott_Gerlt_300.jpg)**_Scott Gerlt, ASA_**\n\nThat approximately 1.2 billion-gallon gap in 2025 between the 15-billion\ngallon conventional biofuel carveout and EPA’s forecast of corn ethanol usage\nis the equivalent of about 700 million gallons of renewable diesel, according\nto Gerlt. (For purposes of the RFS, a gallon of renewable diesel is equivalent\nto 1.7 gallons of ethanol.)\n\nMeanwhile, EPA expects consumption of renewable diesel to grow from less than\n1.36 billion gallons last year to 2 billion gallons this year and 2.6 billion\ngallons by 2025. Biodiesel consumption is expected to slip from 1.71 billion\ngallons in 2022 to 1.62 billion gallons in 2025. Renewable diesel, which can\nbe blended with conventional diesel at higher rates than biodiesel, is rapidly\nbecoming the low-carbon fuel of choice for the trucking sector.\n\nEPA’s rather gloomy forecast for corn ethanol consumption is based on\nprojections of overall gasoline demand, which has been declining as cars get\nmore efficient, and the agency’s expectation of only modest growth in higher\nblends of ethanol. EPA’s forecast, for example, assumes that regulations will\ncontinue to limit year-round sales of E15. ([EPA has proposed a vapor pressure\nwaiver allowing E15 sales year-round in the Midwest, starting next\nyear](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/18978-biofuel-groups-frustrated-by-\nepa-proposal-to-delay-midwest-summer-e15-sales-until-2024), but limits will\ncontinue elsewhere.)\n\n“The expected annual rate of future commercial production of corn ethanol will\nbe driven primarily by gasoline demand as most gasoline is expected to\ncontinue to contain 10% ethanol in the foreseeable future,” EPA says in the\nregulatory impact analysis of its 2023-25 RVOs.\n\nThe biofuel sector — and fuel retailers — aren’t satisfied with the overall\nRVOs set by EPA despite the projected boom in renewable diesel usage. Industry\nofficials believe the agency should have pushed the requirements higher to\nmore closely reflect the expanded soybean processing capacity that is planned\nfor coming years.\n\n“Instead of hitting the accelerator, the EPA is keeping the RFS in neutral,”\nsaid David Fialkov, executive vice president of government affairs for NATSO\nand SIGMA, trade groups that represent truck stops and gasoline retailers.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[Renewable diesel boom fueling soybean crushing\nexpansion](/articles/18588-renewable-diesel-boom-fueling-soybean-crushing-\nexpansion)[EPA proposes canola oil RFS pathway for renewable diesel,\nSAF](/articles/17555-epa-proposes-canola-oil-rfs-pathway-for-renewable-diesel-\nsaf)[Competing ethanol studies on display at Senate\nhearing](/articles/17225-competing-ethanol-studies-on-display-at-senate-\nhearing)\n\n **Don’t miss a beat!

These fuels are commercially available today, and every truck that\nruns on them emits at least 50 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than\ntrucks running on diesel. The final rule is a missed opportunity to\nmeaningfully increase commercial penetration of these lower-carbon diesel\nalternatives.”\n\nIn last week's final rule, EPA disclosed the blending targets in Renewable\nIdentification Numbers, or RINS, which are the compliance credits generated\nthrough the blending or production of biofuels and equal one ethanol-\nequivalent gallon of renewable fuel. The overall RVO for this year of 20.94\nbillion ethanol-equivalent gallons, or Renewable Identification Numbers, or\nRINS, includes 5.94 billion RINs for advanced biofuel, with that number set to\ngrow to 7.33 billion RINs by 2025.\n\nEPA did raise the advanced biofuel requirements from the levels it proposed\nlast November, in part because of [a recent regulatory change that will allow\ncanola oil to qualify as a feedstock for biomass-based\ndiesel](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/17555-epa-proposes-canola-oil-rfs-\npathway-for-renewable-diesel-saf), but the agency was concerned about the\npotential impact on food uses of vegetable oil.\n\nIf all of the planned production expansion occurs, renewable diesel production\nwould top 5.5 billion gallons by the end of 2025, but the agency argues\nfeedstock limitations could force delays or cancellations of projects. Cargill\nInc. put on hold plans announced last year for a new soybean crushing\noperation in southeastern Missouri.\n\nGerlt believes EPA may have overestimated the competing needs for soybean oil;\nthe agency assumes 20% of the increased soybean oil production will go to non-\nfuel uses.\n\nStill, American Bakers Association President and CEO Eric Dell said in a\nstatement to _Agri-Pulse_ that his group was “cautiously optimistic” that EPA\nhad heard his industry’s concern that the RFS would continue driving up\nvegetable oil costs. Prices have soared as high as 80 cents a pound in May\n2022 but have since settled closer to 50 cents, according to EPA.\n\n“Until soybean oil markets reach equilibrium, food producers throughout\nAmerica will remain concerned that biodiesel producers are outcompeting food\nproducers for agricultural crops,” Dell said.\n\n“Propelled by RFS quotas, in recent years, soy oil prices have tripled due to\nthe rapid growth in demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel. The EPA needs\nto constantly assess the new RVOs to ensure food makers will not face an\nedible oils crisis as they have in the past several years.”\n\nFor more news, go to [Agri-Pulse.com](https://www.agri-pulse.com/).\n\n",

Michael Bennet,\nD-Colo., chairman of the forestry subcommittee for the Senate Agriculture\nCommittee.\n\nThe forestry title “is one of the first titles that the staff are working on\ndrafting,” said National Association of State Foresters Policy Director Robyn\nWhitney.\n\n“I think there's a lot of enthusiasm” around discussions of what should be in\nthe title, Whitney said, mentioning the House Agriculture Committee’s\nestablishment of a forestry subcommittee as an example of the importance of\nthe issue.\n\nIn addition, he said passage of both the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 and\nthe 2021 infrastructure law are indications that “Congress is willing to make\nhistorical investments in this area.”\n\nBut the challenges are large.\n\nA recent report from Resources for the Future said aging forests are capturing\nless carbon than they used to, and “expanding forests is necessary to maintain\nland carbon sink strength and meet the nation’s climate goals.”\n\n“Although novel technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and\nstorage or direct air capture, may eventually provide scalable [carbon dioxide\nremoval], lands — and forested lands in particular — currently offer the only\nfeasible means to expand removals on a large scale,” the RFF paper said.\n\nThat report found that the forestry sector generated an annual average of 0.89\ngigatons of negative carbon emissions per year in 1990-1995 but 0.81 gigatons\na year from 2015—2020.\n\nRates of afforestation — planting trees on land that has not recently been\nforested — “have diminished recently, and the mechanics of forest aging\nsuggest a continued decline in CDR (carbon dioxide removal) absent another\nsurge in afforestation,” the report added.\n\nThe Forests in the Farm Bill Coalition, a broad range of forestry and\nenvironmental groups, have endorsed a platform that calls for the restoration\nof forests but also reforestation.\n\nOne of the goals of the coalition, which released its recommendations in May,\nis to “advance the role of forests as a natural climate solution by\nprioritizing reforestation in conservation programs; supporting more\ninvestment and direct assistance to tree nurseries; and supporting voluntary,\nmarket- and incentive-based policies through forestry and forest conservation\nat scale from private U.S. forests, with safeguards to ensure positive\noutcomes for forests and the climate.”\n\nOne solution is an expansion of the National Reforestation, Nursery, and\nGenetics Resources (RNGR) program at USDA, which would include standing up the\nprogram separately and giving it its own line item. The program’s mission is\n“to supply people who grow forest and conservation seedlings with the very\nlatest technical information, and to provide links to other organizations and\nindividuals with similar interests.”\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[Daybreak Dec. 10: Scott eyes early 2022 for farm bill hearings, climate\nbill](/articles/16941-daybreak-dec-10-scott-eyes-early-2022-for-farm-bill-\nhearings-climate-bill)[Daybreak June 6: Inflation, farm bill get Capitol\nHill’s attention](/articles/17794-daybreak-june-6-inflation-farm-bill-get-\ncapitol-hills-attention)[Low-level presence measure in TPP gets high level of\nattention](/articles/7038-low-level-presence-measure-in-tpp-gets-high-level-\nof-attention)\n\nBut NASF says a lot more money needs to go into the infrastructure needed to\nexpand seed and seedling capacity.\n\n“Information sharing to improve technical knowledge and practices, and to\nbetter understand demands, climate change impacts and other issues is\nnecessary.

Having a centralized\nprogram that can serve all the needs across the reforestation pipeline and\nacross the jurisdictional boundaries would really help get more trees in the\nground.”\n\nWhitney said the program receives about $5 million to $7 million now. The\nprecise funding is difficult to calculate because it is spread across\ndifferent programs, but Whitney says the number should be at least doubled.\n\n“NASF is also supportive of exploring opportunities in the farm bill to look\nat the Reforestation Trust Fund as a potential source of revenues for funding\nthe work of RNGR,” he said.\n\nNASF and other groups also would like to see [Good Neighbor\nAuthority](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/farm-bill/gna) expanded. GNA\nallows the Forest Service to enter into agreements with state, county, and\ntribal agencies to perform forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration\nservices on and adjacent to National Forest System lands.\n\nHowever, Whitney says, the 2018 farm bill required that revenues generated by\nGNA projects can only be used for projects on federal lands. “And so we're\nlooking to fix that issue because GNA projects can be cross-boundary in\nnature. And so it just makes sense to us to be able to spend the project\nrevenues within the project boundary,” he said.\n\nMeasures intended for inclusion in the farm bill are being introduced in\nCongress. In the Senate, Bennet has come out with a couple of marker bills —\nincluding [The Protect the West\nAct](https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/1/5/15d99bd0-6a3e-4ae2-a155-8a11347a5f87/72181A5A82204A6AFF9DA997E383DB3E.protect-\nthe-west-act-one-pager.pdf), which carries a $60 billion price tag.\n\nIt would give $20 billion to state and local governments, tribes, special\ndistricts, and nonprofits to support restoration, drought resilience, and fire\nmitigation projects. Another $40 billion would go to partner with states and\ntribes “to tackle the backlog of restoration, fire mitigation, and resilience\nprojects across public, private, and tribal lands,” a summary of the bill\nsays.\n\nAnother, the Headwaters Protection Act, would increase funding for and expand\naccess to the Forest Service’s Water Source Protection Program and require\nWSPP to prioritize “local, collaborative partnerships to protect forests and\nwatersheds.”\n\nThe bill also would create dedicated funding for the service’s Watershed\nCondition Framework and make a technical change to the program “to ensure\nmanagement activities in our National Forests do not lead to the long-term\ndegradation of our watersheds,” according to the summary.\n\nFor more news, go to [www.Agri-Pulse.com](http://www.Agri-Pulse.com).\n\n",

[The rule would deem\n“conservation” as a use for BLM lands, adding it to a list that also includes\ngrazing, energy production, mining and recreation](https://www.agri-\npulse.com/articles/19274-interior-secretary-says-blm-rule-gives-conservation-\nequal-footing).\n\nWhile the BLM emphasized in the rule that the conservation leases should not\ndisturb existing authorizations or preclude land from being used for other\npurposes, the bill’s Republican sponsors worry it could still disrupt the\ngrazing, mining and energy production that takes place on BLM lands.\n\n“This rule would devastate rural economies across the West under the guise of\nconservation,” Arkansas GOP Rep. Bruce Westerman, the chairman of the House\nNatural Resources Committee, said at a hearing last week.\n\nHowever, Nada Wolff Culver, the BLM’s principal deputy director, told the\ncommittee the GOP bill, H.R. 3397, would “unnecessarily interfere with the\nrulemaking process” and “limit BLM’s ability to manage for the challenges\nfacing public lands today.” The BLM “strongly opposes” the bill, she said.\n\nWolff Culver, in her testimony, said under the proposed rule, public land\nmanagers would be directed to identify unhealthy landscapes, using “the best\navailable science and data,” and look at ways to restore them, while also\nconsidering the “appropriate balance of uses within the multiple-use framework\non every acre.”\n\nThrough the proposed rule, the BLM could issue conservation leases of up to 10\nyears for one of two uses: restoration or mitigation. She emphasized that the\nrule does not necessarily mean BLM would be “requiring” conservation leasing,\nbut instead would review applications from third parties and “ensure the\nproponent is experienced in and qualified to achieve the proposed restoration\nor mitigation outcomes” using their own funds.\n\nCompanies could also use conservation leasing to “offset their impacts on\nprivate lands,” she said.\n\nThe BLM would have to follow procedures required under the National\nEnvironmental Policy Act when making decisions to issue conservation leases,\nWolff Culver said.![BLM-lands.png](/ext/resources/2023/06/27/BLM-lands.png)\n\nThe Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the statute governing\nadministration of BLM lands, directs the agency to manage its lands “under\nprinciples of multiple use and sustained yield,” according to a [Congressional\nResearch Service\nreport](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10982). Multiple\nuse, according to the report, requires the agency to ensure lands are\n“utilized in the combination that will best meet the present and future needs\nof the American people,” though it also allows for the agency to make\nadjustments to keep up with “changing needs and conditions.”\n\nSustained yield, according to language from [the\nstatute](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=\\(title:43%20section:1702%20edition:prelim\\)%20OR%20\\(granuleid:USC-\nprelim-title43-section1702\\)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true), is\ndefined as “the achievement and maintenance in perpetuity of a high-level\nannual or regular periodic output of the various renewable resources of the\npublic lands consistent with multiple use.”\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[States, cities file suit over Navigable Waters Protection\nRule](/articles/13594-states-cities-file-suit-over-navigable-waters-\nprotection-rule)[Fiscal ax looms over Conservation Stewardship\nProgram](/articles/11573-fiscal-ax-looms-over-conservation-stewardship-\nprogram)[Proposed BLM grazing EIS sparks differing\nreactions](/articles/13076-proposed-blm-grazing-study-sparks-alternate-\nreactions)\n\nThe CRS report says “the text of the proposed rule focuses on the ‘sustained\nyield’ aspect of BLM’s obligation.” The BLM says the rule is necessary to\n“effectively manage for multiple use and sustained yield in the long term,” in\npart by protecting and restoring habitats, according to the CRS report.\n\n **Don’t miss a beat!

Defenders\nof BLM argue Congress granted the agency the authority to do so through FLPMA.\nThe CRS report notes that the “multiple use” and “sustained yield” definitions\ndo offer the agency “some latitude to interpret the subjective concepts”\nwithin the law and says some courts have been “deferential to agency\nevaluations and interpretations related to land management,” pointing to [one\ncourt opinion](https://casetext.com/case/perkins-v-bergland#p806) that argued\nthese provisions “breathe discretion at every pore.”\n\nKaitlynn Glover, the executive director of the Public Lands Council, a rancher\ngroup affiliated with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association that focuses\non public lands issues, called the rule “problematic” and expressed concern\nthat conservation leases could displace grazing. She also said she was\nconcerned the agency was not considering conservation efforts being undertaken\nby ranchers that use their land for grazing.\n\n“They have separated the concept of conservation from every other multiple\nuse, which is effectively saying they don’t believe that any other multiple-\nuse is doing conservation,” Glover said.\n\nGlover also said she was disappointed in how the agency has handled the rule\nup to this point. She said the five public listening sessions BLM held “were\nnot particularly helpful” and “left permittees feeling like they were telling\nthem and other stakeholders what was going to happen rather than asking for\nfeedback.”\n\n“There was a right way and a wrong way to have this conversation, and at every\nturn the BLM made the wrong choice,” Glover said.\n\nWolff Culver, in her testimony, noted that the final rule could include\nmodifications. She also said the agency will look at the more than 120,000\npublic comments it received before finalizing the rule.\n\nBailey Brennan, a public lands attorney for the National Wildlife Federation,\ntold reporters that conservation leasing would allow sporting organizations\nand members of the public to “take an active role” in restoring public lands.\nShe emphasized that these agreements would be term-limited and be issued for a\n“specific discreet purpose relating to restoration or mitigation.”\n\n“I think it’s also important to remember that conservation leasing and similar\nmechanisms have been used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and in the\nprivate sector for decades,” she said.\n\nFor more news, go to [www.Agri-Pulse.com](https://www.agri-pulse.com/).\n\n",

        "text": "Consumers are starting to slow purchases of plant-based meat alternatives as\ntheir promises of improved sustainability don’t overcome the health\nconsiderations of those alternatives, according to a new report from Rabobank.\n\nJP Frossard, Rabobank consumer foods analyst, told _Agri-Pulse_ the original\ndriver of plant-based products was to mimic meat. But consumers have now\nstarted questioning the healthiness of plant-based products to substitute meat\nthat has gone through extensive processing to try to replicate the taste.\n\n“There is this idea that if you replace meat with plants, plants trump\neverything in terms of sustainability and healthiness,” Frossard said. “The\nconsumer is a bit more skeptical now.”\n\nAccording to Frossard, the top reason many consumers are rejecting plant-based\nmeat is due to uncertainty if replacing meat — either in single-ingredient\nform or a processed item with meat as the primary ingredient — and\nsubstituting it with one that has 15 ingredients that are sometimes even hard\nto say is the healthy choice.\n\nDespite high expectations for widespread consumer acceptance of plant-based\nproteins to substitute meat, sales were down in 2022. Plant-based meat\nalternative sales in U.S. retail in 2022 declined slightly by 1% and unit\nsales declined 8% compared to prior year, according to data from the Good Food\nInstitute and the Plant Based Foods Association commissioned from SPINS, a\nwellness-focused data technology company.\n\nAfter a 47% jump in sales of plant-based meat alternatives in 2020, retail\ndollar sales dropped 9% in the first quarter of 2023, according to consumer\nanalytics firm IRI.\n\n![JP-Frossard-Rabo-300.jpg](/ext/resources/Newsletter-photos/2023/6-28-23/JP-\nFrossard-Rabo-300.jpg)**_JP Frossard, Rabobank_**\n\nDespite some tough economic statistics, many industry analysts still see\nstrong growth possibilities for plant-based products.\n\nFrossard said there are opportunities in the plant-based industry to make\nproducts that inspire more consumer confidence. If plant-based proteins are to\nmove beyond a niche product, offerings should also give consumers satisfaction\nthat the alternatives are good for the body, plants, animals and the\npocketbook.\n\nHe said the marketing strategy for the plant-based industry that tries to\ndemonize meat may be missing the mark as many consumers are flexitarian.\n\n“A lot of products promote themselves by bashing meat by saying that it’s bad\nfor you and the environment and make the customers feel guilty for having any\ntype of animal products,” Frossard said.\n\nInstead, plant-based companies should be applauding the choices of\nflexitarians if they’re choosing a product a few times a week. The companies\ncould, rather, market the product's impact on sustainability, consumer health\nand a balanced diet through diversified nutrient intake, Frossard said.\n\nCompanies who move to fewer and natural ingredients, while still delivering\ngreat taste and a pleasant eating experience at similar prices to premium\nmeat, will establish a stronger hold in the marketplace, Frossard said.\n\n“We expect a growing focus on food as a health driver, perceived\nsustainability and animal welfare benefits, increasing concerns about the\nlevel of processing of food and a refreshed appeal for convenience-at-home to\ngradually bolster plant-based products,” Frossard wrote in the report.\n\nSpeaking on an industry webinar, Daniel Gertner, GFI's business analyst,\nprojected moderate growth for the industry in 2023, but said he believes\nplant-based sales and investment growth in several regions are both building\nmomentum in the global market.\n\n“Plant-based meats’ environmental benefits mean it’ll remain an important ESG\nconsideration even in difficult market conditions,” he said.\n\nEmma Ignaszewski, GFI's associate director of industry intelligence and\ninitiatives, said based on conservative estimates, plant-based meat\nalternatives tend to emit 86% less greenhouse gas emissions than conventional\nmeat. “We know that plant-based meat is an incredible tool for mitigating\nclimate change and biodiversity loss as well as providing the protein\nconsumers need,” she said.\n\nHowever, Ignaszewski said only 21% of plant-based consumers identify\nenvironmental benefits as a reason why they purchase plant-based proteins. She\nsaid the plant-based industry needs to continue working toward innovations and\nscale-up so it can allow products to be more price-competitive with\nconventional animal products.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[Courts may provide guidance on plant and cell-based meat labeling\nlaws](/articles/12610-courts-may-provide-guidance-on-meat-labeling-\nlaws)[Plant-based product makers look to lure US\nfarmers](/articles/15835-plant-based-product-makers-look-to-lure-us-\nfarmers)[Plant-based, animal protein demand shows no sign of letting\nup](/articles/11933-plant-based-animal-protein-demand-shows-no-sign-of-\nletting-up)\n\nFrossard agreed sustainability claims for plant-based meat alternatives can’t\nchange food habits on their own. He cited a Moonshot Collaborative analysis\nfinding “78% of interviewed U.S. consumers would not, or would only slightly,\nincrease their purchases of a regularly purchased food product if its\ningredients became more sustainable while keeping taste and price unchanged,\nversus only 18% that affirmed they would buy a lot more.”\n\n“At the same time, the same survey revealed that 59% consider a simple and\nfamiliar list of ingredients as very or extremely important,” the report\nadded.\n\nGovernments are stepping up to the plate to diversify protein supplies with\nlast year seeing significant investments around the world to increase\nconsumption of plant-based proteins.\n\nDomestically, support for alternative protein R&D was secured at both the\nfederal and state levels, with Congress allocating nearly $6 million to USDA\nand California allocating $5 million to three universities. USDA has awarded\nabout $15 million in research funding to 12 alternative protein research\nprojects at universities across the country since 2020.\n\n![Emma_Ignaszewski_300.jpg](/ext/resources/Newsletter-\nphotos/2023/6-28-23/Emma_Ignaszewski_300.jpg)**_Emma Ignaszewski, GFI_**\n\n“Some of the largest and most impactful public investments in plant-based\nproteins were made in 2022, with more governments around the world allocating\nmore funding to more projects for more reasons,” said Michael Carter, GFI\npolicy associate.\n\n**Don’t miss a beat!

For the latest on what’s happening in Washington, D.C. and around the\ncountry in agriculture, **[**just click here.**](https://www.agri-\npulse.com/subscription)\n\nPenny Eastman, GFI associate legislative director, said GFI thinks the farm\nbill could provide opportunities to advance alternative protein production.\n\n“For decades, the programs and resources included in the farm bill have helped\nto advance sustainable solutions to the many challenging issues pertaining to\nfood production, food insecurity and adaptation to new developments in\nagriculture,” Eastman said. “We look to the farm bill as a vehicle to increase\ninvestments in alternative protein research, which can lead to exponential\ngrowth in the U.S. economy, maintain our country’s global leadership in\nprotein innovation and provide new export market opportunities for American\nagriculture.”\n\nSpecifically, GFI wants to see alternative proteins as a new research activity\nallowed within the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. Most plant-based\nmeat alternatives leverage just a handful of plant protein bases such as soy\nand wheat. GFI said additional research into other plant-protein bases could\nlead to better optimized ingredients and product outcomes.\n\nThe group is also seeking an increase in the loan cap guarantees for USDA’s\nRural Development loan guarantee programs.\n\nAnother component of GFI’s focus in the upcoming farm bill discussion is the\ninclusion of $15 million in annual funding for alternative protein innovation\nat Centers of Excellence including at 1890 institutions.\n\nLate in 2021, Denmark pursued its greenhouse gas reduction goals by announcing\na wide-ranging plan to build out its plant-based protein industry, including\nincentivizing farmers to grow protein-rich crops and developing a market for\nplant-based products. In 2022, the country began to deliver on that pledge by\ninvesting nearly $100 million to support research and market development,\nCarter explained.\n\nCarter said in Canada, they invested $127 million in 55 projects through the\nend of 2022. As a significant producer of protein-rich crops such as yellow\npeas and canola, Canada is financing infrastructure for plant protein\nprocessing and supporting the development of new products to stimulate its\ndomestic economy and value-added agricultural products.\n\nAustralia's national government invested $75 million in three new plant\nprotein processing facilities, in addition to $43 million provided by the\nstate of South Australia bringing total government funding to over $117\nmillion.\n\n“The government expects these facilities to create 8,500 jobs, allow farmers\nto value add their crops eight times over and bolster Australia's export\nmarket to the rest of Asia,” Carter said.\n\nSingapore, meanwhile, responded to 2022 food supply chain disruptions by\nsupporting the development of a high moisture extrusion contract manufacturing\nfacility that can produce as much plant-based protein as 4.3 million chicken\nbreasts.\n\nEarlier this year, Malaysia banned exports of chicks to neighboring Singapore\nin a bid to control high prices in the wake of food supply volatility; the\nmove reduced Singapore's supply of chicken by one-third. The new facility will\nsupport more domestic food production as the country strives to produce 30% of\nits own food by 2030.\n\nFor more news, visit [www.Agri-Pulse.com](//www.Agri-Pulse.com).\n\n",

Bonnie announced the investments on\nTuesday at the Western Governors Association meeting in Boulder, Colo.\n\n“Our hope here is to just send a message to our partners, states, conservation\ngroups, and producer groups that we're in this for the long haul, that we want\nto look for opportunities to work together,” Bonnie added.\n\nThe new funding includes $250 million from the Agricultural Conservation\nEasement Program (ACEP) and $250 million from the Environmental Quality\nIncentives Program (EQIP). In addition, USDA is committing $30 million over\nfive years to expand the WLFW team’s science and coordination capacity through\npartnerships.\n\nIn a first for the agency, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and\nFarm Service Agency will coordinate their delivery of conservation programs,\nincluding the Conservation Reserve Program, through WLFW.\n\nSome of these efforts grew out of a project with Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon in\nWyoming, as USDA looked at ways to use CRP, particularly the grasslands side\nof CRP, to help producers deal with some of the challenges associated with\nconserving range lands when you have both big game and livestock out there,\nBonnie said.\n\nHe noted that fewer crop acres are going into the CRP general signup right now\nbecause of commodity prices, yet more land is coming into the grasslands\nprogram.\n\n“It creates opportunities for NRCS and FSA to work together and coordinate. We\nare also looking at ways we can take, for example, NRCS dollars and apply them\non grasslands if we need to update fencing, or there was a serious invasive\nspecies challenge,” Bonnie explained. “The ability to stack those dollars\ngives us more benefits for producers.”\n\nThe new USDA funds will immediately benefit two of WLFW’s newest priorities,\naccording to a USDA release.\n\nIn the western U.S., at least $40 million of EQIP and ACEP funding will go\ntoward USDA’s ongoing efforts to help conserve migratory big game habitat,\ncontinuing an existing partnership with the state of Wyoming and an expansion\nto the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[USDA opens RCPP to more forest lands](/articles/14694-usda-opens-rcpp-to-\nmore-forest-lands)[Want more conservation on the land?

Many of those concerns are now being\naddressed through an updated flow chart of the proposed reorganization as FDA\nworks toward finalizing the reorganization plan this fall.\n\nFDA Commissioner Robert Califf told _Agri-Pulse_ that while many people\ndisagreed with specifics of the plan, the “overarching theme of almost\neveryone was clarity of decision-making power and purpose so they can just do\ntheir jobs.”\n\nFDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Janet Woodcock told _Agri-Pulse_ the agency\nhas conducted more than 40 listening sessions in the past several months to\nhear reactions to the proposal from FDA's staff as well as their thoughts on\nexternal criticism of the proposed plan. FDA also put together an\nimplementation and change management group, which currently has about 50\npeople involved, to help with designing the reorganization.\n\nIn the wake of [last year's infant formula crisis](https://www.agri-\npulse.com/articles/18110-infant-formula-shortage-is-easing-but-not-likely-to-\nbe-resolved-quickly), caused when a plant shutdown created supply shortages\nacross the country, FDA came under fire for not having a person in charge of\nthe human side of the foods program at the agency. The [Reagan-Udall\nreport](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/18584-fda-human-foods-program-\nneeds-clear-leadership-report-says) called for clear leadership and revealed a\nhistory of disjointed organizational structure.\n\nWoodcock, who is overseeing the reorganization efforts, said the proposed plan\nis “flattening the organization.” Instead of the previous hierarchy and its\nmultiple steps or layers of different programs, different divisions and groups\nwill work “hand-in-glove” with each other as defined by the organizational\nflow chart.\n\n“People were really eager to have clear decisional lines of authority and to\nhave clear priorities so we’re not just doing risk assessment. We’re going to\ndo very formal risk prioritization, so people know what are the highest\npriorities, and they’re not trying to respond to multiple different\npriorities,” Woodcock said.\n\n![FDA-human-foods-program-flow-chart-62723.jpg](/ext/resources/2023/06/27/FDA-\nhuman-foods-program-flow-chart-62723.jpg)\n\nCaliff said FDA is in the “final stages of interviews” for the deputy\ncommissioner position. The agency also will name a new associate commissioner\nfor regulatory affairs to lead ORA through the proposed changes.\n\n“The head of the Human Foods Program will have accountability and authority\nover resources and priorities,” Califf said.\n\n[FDA’s newest proposal further defines the core mission of\nORA](https://www.fda.gov/media/169815/download) as overseeing investigations,\ninspections and imports for all FDA-regulated products. The plan also\ntransitions certain functions under the Office of Security and Emergency\nManagement, currently in the Office of Operations, to ORA, FDA said. The\nagency also may rename the ORA to more accurately reflect what the division\ndoes, he said.\n\nWoodcock said another major change developed through feedback on the plan was\nthe need to reform how the laboratories are managed. “Certainly, all of us\nthought the laboratories was something that we didn't go in thinking that was\nas much of an issue;\" however, the listening sessions revealed otherwise.\n\nFDA now plans to realign the eight human and animal food laboratories\ncurrently managed by ORA into the Human Foods Program into four “super\nlaboratories” at FDA’s current Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n(CFSAN) to form a unified food lab system.\n\nFDA said, “The labs will report to a member of the executive leadership team\nunder the deputy commissioner for human foods, who will work closely with the\nchief scientist and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) director to\ncoordinate on research priorities. These labs will remain open and in the same\ngeographic location under the proposal.”\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[External review will help guide FDA's overhaul of human foods\nprogram](/articles/18590-external-review-will-help-guide-fdas-overhaul-of-\nhuman-foods-program)[FDA human foods program needs clear leadership, report\nsays](/articles/18584-fda-human-foods-program-needs-clear-leadership-report-\nsays)[Daybreak July 20: FDA engaging outside experts to review human foods\nprograms](/articles/18001-daybreak-july-20-fda-engaging-outside-experts-to-\nreview-human-foods-programs)\n\n **Don’t miss a beat!

That’s down from the\nforecast of 6.3% in May and 8.6% back in February.\n\nThe lower forecast reflects the continued softening in food prices.\n[Supermarket prices edged up 0.1% in May after falling 0.2% in April and 0.3%\nin March.](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/19552-grocery-prices-up-\nslightly-in-may)\n\n **By comparison:** The 20-month average increase for supermarket prices is\n2.5%.\n\nThe biggest drivers of food inflation for this year are expected to be fats\nand oils, processed fruits and vegetables, cereal and bakery products, and\nsugar and sweets.

Courts have\nrepeatedly criticized EPA for not completing the consultations, which can take\nyears, and have ordered EPA in particular cases to complete them within\nspecific time frames, forcing EPA to devote its resources to ensure\ncompliance.\n\nThe species have “limited geographic range, small population size, and high\nsusceptibility to environmental stressors such that effects to even a small\nnumber of individuals can harm the entire species,” [the agency said in a news\nrelease](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-marks-national-pollinator-week-\nproposing-protections-27-most-vulnerable-endangered).\n\nThe species include 12 plants, seven invertebrates and four mussels, as well\nas a fish, bird, mammal and an amphibian. EPA is seeking public comment before\nfinalizing the plan.\n\nEPA and the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service, which is\nresponsible for enforcement of the ESA, “may develop a pesticide programmatic\nconsultation, or other streamlining process, that will include the evaluation\nof pesticide exposure to pilot species using the Vulnerable Species Pilot,”\n[the draft document released by EPA\nsays](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/EPA-HQ-OPP-2023-0327).\n\n“Pollinator health affects biodiversity, ecosystems, global food supplies, and\nhuman health,” **** EPA Deputy Assistant Administrator for Pesticide Programs\nJake Li said. **** “The proposed mitigations … are tailored to where these 27\nlisted species, including pollinators, live and our new maps make it easy for\npeople to find and visualize this important information.”\n\n“By implementing these earlier mitigations, EPA expects that a programmatic or\nother consultation could be more efficient and potentially allow FWS to make\nfinal determinations concluding that the actions are not likely to jeopardize\nthe pilot species or adversely modify their designated critical habitats,” the\ndraft says.\n\nEPA expects the proposed mitigation measures “would apply to the majority of\nconventional outdoor-use pesticides.”\n\n“Because the pilot species are some of the most vulnerable to potential\neffects, EPA designed the mitigation measures to be broad enough that the\nmitigations protect the pilot species while being implemented efficiently and\neffectively, and clear enough that pesticide users can understand and apply\nthe use-limitation instructions,” the draft document says.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity, which has brought multiple lawsuits\nseeking to force EPA and FWS to consult, said it was pleased with the draft.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[EPA workplan seeks to address pesticide bottleneck over endangered\nspecies](/articles/17526-epa-workplan-seeks-to-address-pesticide-bottleneck-\nover-endangered-species)[EPA proposes atrazine restrictions to protect aquatic\nplants ](/articles/17929-epa-proposes-atrazine-restrictions-to-protect-\naquatic-plants)[EPA hit with court order on insecticide as it tackles\nendangered species compliance](/articles/18536-epa-hit-with-court-order-on-\ninsecticide-as-it-tries-to-tackle-endangered-species-compliance)\n\n **Don’t miss a beat!

The restrictions, the draft document said, “are made\nenforceable through directions to access and follow them on pesticide\nlabeling.”\n\nAmong the measures being considered for certain species, such as the Rusty\npatched bumble bee, are prohibitions on applications within specific areas\n“unless the applicator coordinates with the local FWS Ecological Services\nfield offices to determine appropriate measures to ensure the proposed\napplication is likely to have no more than minor effects on the species.”\n\nFor broadcast spray applications in the range of other species covered by the\npilot, EPA is considering not allowing spraying within specific distances from\n“sinkholes, springs, disappearing streams or known openings of cave systems.”\n\nFor 25 species where runoff or erosion is a concern, EPA is proposing a ban on\napplications “when soil in the area to be treated is saturated” along with\nother restrictions that would require growers to follow the weather reports\nclosely.\n\nFor example, the draft proposes the following language for those 25 species:\n“Do not apply if NOAA/National Weather Service predicts 50% chance or greater\nof 1 or more inches of rainfall to occur within 48 hours following\napplication.”\n\nFor more news, go to [www.Agri-Pulse.com](http://www.Agri-Pulse.com).\n\n",

        "text": "Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Friday announced $2.7 billion in total\nfunding from USDA's Commodity Credit Corp. account to build domestic\nfertilizer capacity, support school meal providers and fund emergency\ncommodity purchases by states.\n\nVilsack is pulling an additional $400 million from the CCC to fund domestic\nfertilizer expansion projects, to go with $500 million announced last year for\nthe initiative.\n\nThe first round of funding focused on immediate assistance with [21 potential\nviable projects](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/01/09/usda-\nannounces-major-program-improvements-progress-and-investments) identified\nearlier this year. On Friday, the department announced $30 million in grants\nto seven of those projects to benefit farmers in Florida, Iowa, Louisiana,\nMinnesota, Montana, Texas and Wisconsin. Some projects will build or expand\nnew dry fertilizer production.\n\nVilsack told reporters USDA has received 350 applications during the last\nseveral months for nearly $3 billion to help with longer-term projects. The\nagency is now seeking 66 of those proposals that are potentially worthy to\ntake to the next level. Comments are due by July 22.\n\nVilsack said the \"these 66 worthy projects\" showed that the additional CCC\nfunding would be needed.\n\n“We see the benefit of this investment will provide over time a much more\nresilient supply chain, lower costs for farmers, rural job growth as part of\nthis administration's effort to encourage manufacturing processing in rural\nplaces,\" he said.\n\nUSDA will provide nearly $1 billion  through The Emergency Food Assistance\nProgram – TEFAP – for states to order commodities from USDA to provide to food\nbanks or community kitchens. This is in addition to $1 billion previously\nprovided in September 2022.\n\nVilsack said food banks and community kitchens have seen increased demand, in\nlarge part because of the ending of the emergency allotments, which provided\nnearly $3 billion of additional benefits, in the Supplemental Nutrition\nAssistance Program.

        "text": "The Senate Finance Committee used a hearing Thursday to highlight the fact\nthat Brazilian packers are producing beef from cattle raised illegally on land\nonce made up of lush Amazon jungle, and some of the beef from those animals\nmay end up in the U.S. market, competing with U.S.-raised product.\n\nLarge swaths of Amazon rainforest are burned or cut down every year in Brazil,\npaving the way for ranchers to raise cattle illegally. Brazilian packers –\nincluding JBS, which is considered one of the “big four” meatpackers in the\nU.S. – say they are trying to avoid buying cattle raised on deforested Amazon\nland, but it remains difficult to do so.\n\nCommittee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who focused much of his frustration over\nthe illegal ranching on JBS, laid out the crux of the problem: Brazilian\nranchers, he said, “take cattle born and raised on illegally deforested land\nand ship them to ranches with clean records. Suddenly those cattle are no\nlonger considered the product of illegal deforestation. Upon buying and\nprocessing that cattle, JBS can claim they’re upholding their commitment to\nprotect the Amazon.”\n\nThat system, called cattle laundering, is indeed a major problem, said Jason\nWeller, global chief sustainability officer for JBS and a witness at the\n[hearing](https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/cattle-supply-chains-and-\ndeforestation-of-the-amazon).\n\nJBS, he said, has a “zero-tolerance deforestation sourcing policy” when it\ncomes to buying cattle, but JBS doesn’t yet have the ability to fully avoid\nthose laundered cattle.\n\nBrazil does have an animal tracking system in which the government requires\nranchers to provide cattle transport permits, or GTAs. The problem, said\nwitness Rick Jacobsen, commodities policy manager for the nonprofit\nEnvironmental Investigation Agency, is the system is rife with fraud and the\ngovernment is reducing public access to the records.\n\n“We can get those records from our direct suppliers, but the issue is the\nhundreds of thousands of ranchers above them that supply cattle in the\nindirect supply chain, and we’re investing in building that capacity to get\nthe traceability,” Weller said.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[G-7 ag ministers take aim at global fertilizer woes](/articles/17695-g7-ag-\nministers-take-aim-at-global-fertilizer-woes)[Dem candidates take aim at\nTrump’s China trade war](/articles/12558-dem-candidates-take-aim-at-trumps-\nchina-trade-war)[Wildfires take toll on humans, livestock in central\nUS](/articles/9015-wildfires-take-toll-on-humans-livestock-in-central-us)\n\nWhile GTAs help in knowing where Brazilian cattle were raised, a comprehensive\nanimal ID program – something not being developed in Brazil – would be the\nbest solution, Weller said.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazilian beef is making its way to the U.S. market, Leo McDonnell,\na Montana rancher representing the United States Cattlemen’s Association, said\nat the hearing. Despite rising concerns about Amazon deforestation, Brazilian\nbeef production and exports are increasing, which is taking a toll on U.S.\nranchers, he said.\n\nWeller played down the impact of Brazilian beef exports on U.S. ranchers,\nsaying Brazil only exports about 25% of its beef and, of that, only about 2%\nis shipped to the U.S.\n\nBut McDonnell said that's still a lot of meat – about 460 million pounds of\nbeef in 2022, or 65,000 head of cattle.\n\n“What you have to remember is we have a very supply-sensitive industry,” said\nMcDonnell, who added that often imports come in surges and suppress domestic\nprices.\n\nFor more news, go to [www.Agri-Pulse.com](//www.Agri-Pulse.com)\n\n  \n\n",

While that is less than President Joe\nBiden proposed, it’s far more new funding than the House version would\nauthorize, creating an enormous gap that will have to be bridged in\nnegotiations between the two chambers.\n\nThe [House Appropriations Committee’s Agriculture bill would provide for about\n$25 billion in total spending for USDA and FDA in FY24](https://www.agri-\npulse.com/articles/19569-house-gop-advances-usda-funding-bill-after-softening-\nblow-to-electric-co-ops), but the bill relies on the $8 billion in funding\nrescissions that have virtually no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled\nSenate.\n\nWithout those rescissions, which include cuts to clean energy funding and\n[distressed-borrower assistance provided by the Inflation Reduction\nAct](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/19587-house-gop-effort-to-cut-usda-\ndebt-relief-faces-uphill-legislative-battle), there is a $9 billion difference\nbetween the two bills.\n\nThe $9 billion gap “makes it very challenging” to negotiate the final bill,\nSen. John Hoeven, the top Republican on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations\nSubcommittee, told reporters. “We realize there are going to have to be some\ncompromises.”\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the House and Senate bills is in\nfunding for the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program. The Senate bill\nfully funds the program at $6.3 billion, while the House would freeze spending\nat the FY23 level of $6 billion and [eliminate an increase in benefits for\nfruits and vegetables that started during the COVID-19\npandemic](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/19585-wic-fruit-and-vegetable-\nbenefits-targeted-in-fiscal-debate).\n\nSimilarly, the Senate bill would fund USDA’s Agricultural Research Service at\n$1.79 billion, well below the White House request of $1.94 billion.

The\nHouse bill provides $260 million in new funding compared to $98 million in the\nSenate version.\n\nReConnect was funded at $348 million for fiscal 2023, which ends Sept. 30.

Two more were issued jointly by FWS and the National Marine Fisheries\nService.

After Joe Biden was elected president,\nthe new administration decided the regulations warranted review.\n\nIn one of the three proposals, FWS and NMFS said they plan to restore\nregulatory language “to clarify and affirm that, consistent with the plain\nlanguage of the statute, the economic impacts and any other impacts that might\nflow from a listing decision must not be taken into account when making\nlisting, reclassification, and delisting (collectively, classification)\ndeterminations.”\n\n[They also proposed language](https://public-\ninspection.federalregister.gov/2023-13053.pdf) that would make it easier to\ndesignate as critical habitat areas unoccupied by a species as critical\nhabitat.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[Wildlife agencies act to reverse Trump's Endangered Species Act\nchanges](/articles/15990-wildlife-agencies-acting-to-reverse-trump-endangered-\nspecies-act-changes)[Feds release proposals to limit reach of Endangered\nSpecies Act](/articles/11251-feds-release-proposals-to-limit-reach-of-\nendangered-species-act)[Trump endangered species rules reinstated by appeals\ncourt](/articles/18278-trump-endangered-species-rules-back-in-effect-after-\nappeals-court-ruling)\n\nSpecifically, FWS and NMFS proposed removal of a sentence saying that the\nservices would only consider unoccupied areas as essential for a species’\nconservation if currently occupied habitat were deemed inadequate.\n\n“Neither the Act nor the legislative history creates a requirement to exhaust\noccupied areas before considering designation of unoccupied areas,” that\nproposal says.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity, a frequent plaintiff in lawsuits brought\nagainst FWS, EPA and other federal agencies, said that taken together, the\nproposals retain “a number of harmful provisions governing the responsibility\nof federal agencies to avoid jeopardizing protected species or adversely\nmodifying their critical habitat. In particular, it retains a definition of\nadverse modification that requires federal actions to affect species’ critical\nhabitat ‘as a whole’ before real habitat protections are put in place.”\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council took a more upbeat view. Staff attorney\nLucas Rhoads said the proposals “would restore many of the protections that\nhad been lost, strengthening key habitat safeguards and restoring common-sense\nprotections to recover species and prevent them from sliding further towards\nextinction.”\n\nThe updates are a “a mixed bag, with some troubling Trump-era changes\nremaining in place,” Rhoads said. Nevertheless, he added, “the Endangered\nSpecies Act is poised for a much happier 50th anniversary now than it was\nbefore these revisions were released.”\n\nThe proposals will be published in the Federal Register Thursday, triggering a\n60-day comment period.\n\nFor more news, go to [www.Agri-Pulse.com](http://www.Agri-Pulse.com).\n\n",

Some deflation occurred for some ingredients including chicken,\nlettuce and tomatoes.\n\nBailey said even at these elevated prices, consumers are proving resilient in\nmanaging higher food costs as they choose food as an experience worth\nsplurging on.\n\n“We may see spending heat up as consumers trade up to more premium products to\nmake this year’s barbecue a more memorable one,” he said.\n\nCommodity price increases in 2021 resulted in higher costs which passed on to\nconsumers in 2022, Bailey said.\n\n“Commodity prices have eased, but we are not seeing it yet in consumer\nprices,” Bailey said. “Retail prices historically are quite sticky on the way\ndown. Rather than retailers just dropping their prices, we’re more likely to\nsee some discounts and some promotional activity picking up for this year’s\nbarbecue.”\n\nMillennials, now the nation's largest consumer group, are generally willing to\nmake those increased purchases if it creates an improved experience. This is\nespecially true in the beef market, where demand is holding up better than\nexpected despite competing pressures on a macroeconomic level, said Lance\nZimmerman, Rabobank senior animal protein analyst.\n\nBeef prices, which consist of 14% of the Rabobank barbecue cost breakdown, are\nat record levels in 2023. Zimmerman said he anticipates beef prices to remain\nelevated not only through the rest of the year but for the next several years\nbecause of the ongoing drought, which first began in 2019, and a stage in the\ncattle cycle where cattlemen are starting to aggressively cull herds.\n\n“In 2023, while the culling is slowing starting to subside as the drought is\ngetting more manageable, what we’re seeing is that the U.S. cow herd and the\ndeclines that had taken place the last several years are showing up in the\nbeef supply,” Zimmerman said with cattle slaughter down 5% year-to-date. “Our\nexpectation is new record highs in retail beef prices as we navigate through\nthis year” and continued higher prices into 2024 and 2025.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[Fourth of July cookouts to cost 17% more, AFBF finds](/articles/17907-fourth-\nof-july-cookouts-cost-17-more)[FAO: Food commodity prices fell again in\nJuly](/articles/18084-food-commodity-prices-dip-sharply-in-july)[Daybreak July\n14: Food prices spike as Consumer Price Index jumps](/articles/16176-daybreak-\njuly-14-food-prices-spike-as-consumer-price-index-jumps)\n\nHe believes a higher percentage of these higher retail beef prices are going\nto find their way back to farmers and “encourage the next expansion and\nessentially make the U.S. cattle producer more profitable again after years of\nsuffering some losses.”\n\nConsumers also did not trade down to pork or poultry when beef prices\nincreased as they did in the 80s, 90s and even into the 2000s.\n\n“A pound of choice beef today costs a little over $7, approaching $8 a pound.\nWith average per capita incomes where they are that works out to basically the\naverage U.S. consumer needing to work less than 15 minutes to pay for a pound\nof choice beef,” Zimmerman said. “That pound of choice beef can feed that\nfamily of four a meal. And so even as one of the most expensive items in the\ngrocery basket, it still is an incredible value.”\n\nOther products that stood out with increases in the barbecue cart include bun\ncosts, up 51%, and potato chips, which increased 46%. JP Frossard, a Rabobank\nconsumer analyst, said fresh bread prices have increased double digits since\nlast summer due to the war in Ukraine and a corresponding surge in wheat\nprices, and some of that was catching up from elevated wheat prices over the\nlast six years that hadn’t been passed onto consumers.\n\n![FourthofJulyFoodCosts-\nRabobank.jpg](/ext/resources/2023/06/21/FourthofJulyFoodCosts-Rabobank.jpg)\n\nWheat prices remain 73% higher than three years ago, but margins for bakeries\nwill remain under pressure with high costs of labor, energy, packaging and\nother commodities included in the cost of bread such as sugar and edible oils,\nFrossard said.\n\nConsumers may see some relief in dairy products, although it may not be\nrealized by consumers this summer, said Lucas Fuess, dairy analyst. “Milk\nprices paid to dairy farmers are relatively low, well below some of the\nrecords that we saw one year ago. Eventually those lower prices will trickle\nthrough to the consumer,” he said.\n\nIn the alcohol category, beverage analyst Jim Watson noted that consumers are\nalso looking for an improved experience, which may have them looking at more\ncostly beers with higher alcohol levels to provide “more bang for your buck.”\nBeer is facing stiffer competition from ready-to-drink cocktails and hard\nseltzers; brewers can’t increase prices so much that they lose market share to\nthe wine and spirits markets.\n\nSoda prices have shot up 36% in the past 18 months and the major players are\nlooking to take prices even higher, Rabobank reported.\n\nFor more news, visit [www.Agri-Pulse.com](//www.Agri-Pulse.com).\n\n",

        "text": "The Biden administration has issued the first approvals for cell-cultivated\nmeat production in the United States, giving the green light to two companies\nto start producing chicken for human consumption.\n\nUSDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service issued “grants of inspection”\nWednesday to UPSIDE Foods and GOOD Meat following [completion of a premarket\nconsultation process at the Food and Drug Administration](https://www.agri-\npulse.com/articles/18512-fda-greenlights-first-cultivated-chicken-from-\ncultured-cells) and a separate “rigorous process, which includes assessing a\nfirm’s food safety system” at USDA. A third grant was also issued to JOINN\nBiologics, a contract manufacturing partner with GOOD Meat.\n\n“Based on this review, FSIS has issued the first three grants of inspection to\nestablishments producing FSIS-regulated products derived from animal cells,”\nan FSIS spokesperson said in a statement. “FSIS has also reviewed and approved\nthe labels for their product to ensure that they are truthful and not\nmisleading.”\n\nThe news is historic, representing the first companies to complete the [joint\nFDA-USDA regulatory process for the technology finalized in\n2019](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/11978-usda-fda-finalize-cultured-\nmeat-regulatory-agreement). Under that framework, FDA oversees cell collection\nand growth while USDA has jurisdiction over the processing and labeling of the\nproducts. The process is [similar to a 2018 suggestion jointly\noffered](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/11364-nami-memphis-meats-offer-\nregulatory-suggestions-for-cell-based-meat) by UPSIDE Foods — then doing\nbusiness under its former name Memphis Meats — and the North American Meat\nInstitute, which represents meat processing companies.\n\n“This approval will fundamentally change how meat makes it to our table,” Uma\nValeti, UPSIDE’s founder and CEO, said in a statement. “It’s a giant step\nforward towards a more sustainable future — one that preserves choice and\nlife. We are excited to launch with our signature, whole-textured UPSIDE\nchicken and can’t wait for consumers to taste the future.”\n\nGOOD Meat, the cultivated meat arm of Eat Just, was previously granted\npermission to sell the chicken in Singapore in 2020, making it the first\ncompany to receive approval anywhere in the world. Now, company founder and\nCEO Josh Tetrick said the company was pleased to be “approved to sell to\ncustomers in the world’s largest economy.”\n\n“This announcement that we’re now able to produce and sell cultivated meat in\nthe United States is a major moment for our company, the industry and the food\nsystem,” he said. “We appreciate the rigor and thoughtfulness that both the\nFDA and USDA have applied during this historic two-agency regulatory process.”\n\nFormer Ag Secretary Dan Glickman, a member of GOOD Meat’s advisory board, said\nin a statement the approval “demonstrates that the United States is a global\nleader in the promising alternative protein space while also continuing to\nsupport family farmers’ efforts to feed the world through conventional food\nand agriculture techniques.”\n\nNAMI President and CEO Julie Anna Potts noted the organization's previous work\nwith cultivated meat producers, particularly UPSIDE Foods.\n\n“We have worked closely with Upside Foods to create a level regulatory playing\nfield ensuring USDA had a role to play in oversight of both traditional meat\nand cell-cultivated products. We look forward to continuing our work with\nUpside on future innovations,” she said in a statement to _Agri-Pulse_.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[FDA greenlights first cultivated chicken from cultured\ncells](/articles/18512-fda-greenlights-first-cultivated-chicken-from-cultured-\ncells)[USDA declines to appeal hog line speed ruling; plants told to slow\nproduction](/articles/15947-usda-declines-to-appeal-hog-line-speed-ruling-\nplants-told-to-slow-production)[USDA spending bill seeks protections on China\nchicken imports](/articles/9559-usda-spending-bill-seeks-protections-on-china-\nchicken-imports)\n\nThe National Chicken Council, the trade association for the U.S. broiler\nchicken industry, said it was confident the preference of consumers would\nremain with conventional chicken.\n\n“It is imperative that cell-cultured products like these be properly\nregulated, inspected and labeled by both USDA and FDA,” NCC President Mike\nBrown said in a statement to _Agri-Pulse_. “Americans are set to eat a record\namount of chicken this year, and we don’t see that demand waning. I think most\nAmericans want their chicken raised on a farm, not in a laboratory.”\n\nWith FSIS grants of inspection in hand, the companies are now free to begin\nproduction of cultivated chicken. FSIS said it “conducts inspection activities\nat the facility at least once per shift to verify the production of safe and\nproperly labeled product.”\n\nSpokespersons for both companies did not respond to questions about production\ntimelines or capacity, but the product is widely expected to initially be\navailable at a very small scale.\n\nBoth companies seized on the news.\n\nGOOD Meat noted in a release that “immediately after receiving the grant of\ninspection, production started for the first batch of cultivated chicken.” The\nproduct will be sold to chef José Andrés for use in one of his restaurants.\n\nUPSIDE said it processed the first restaurant order after receiving regulatory\napproval for chef Dominique Crenn for her Bar Crenn restaurant in San\nFrancisco. The company also announced an online contest to win a trip to San\nFrancisco, where the winner would be one of the first people to try the chef’s\ncell-cultivated chicken dish.\n\nThe winner will also receive a tour of UPSIDE’s production facility; an email\noutlining the contest does note a spoiler alert ahead of the tour, however.\n\n“One thing you won’t see on the tour? Chickens!”\n\nFor more news, go to [www.Agri-Pulse.com](http://www.Agri-Pulse.com).\n\n",
